Whether you need to work, meditate, sleep, or any other use, Environments is the only ambient sound app based on extended recordings created in the 1960s and 70s on analog tape. Environments began as an unprecedented series of vinyl records, garnering widespread acclaim and selling millions of units. Now Environments steps into the mobile age as an invaluable and unique sonic tool for the way YOU live.\n",

      "Thanks for your feedback. I named 'parabens' off the top of my head, but after your comment I asked my doctor/nutritionist about it. She said that there's no clear science on parabens, but it's found in breast cancer tissue and is thought of as endocrine disruptor, so she recommends to avoid them. Other avoidable toxins according to her include phthalates, aluminum, fluoride, triclosan, and other artificial additives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her other point is, cancer is not the only bad outcome of using these additives. They can disrupt gut flora, create hormonal imbalances, aggravate immune system, and while our body is really good at resilience towards toxins, it cannot keep up forever with the onslaught of inflammation and endless whack-a-mole it has to perform based on our lifestyle (read: diet/nutrition and exercise/movement) choices.\n",

At the very basic level it's taught in yoga classes, which are mostly about movement and just a tiny bit about philosophy, is that setting an intention just for that one hour of practice makes a world of difference in the outcome of that hour-long practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Same is true for intentions that are necessary to complete a goal requiring weeks, months, or years of effort - wanting something badly enough, and writing it down in a journal to make that desire pronounced, kicks off a process that sometimes leads us to the goal without us even realizing. At least, that's the claim that I've heard many times and have seen, surprisingly, in my life - and I'm a skeptic when it comes to spirituality. So, I'd like to believe that it works, and that even if there's a small chance that it works, it makes sense to set intentions, even if for the purpose of knowing the direction to take through daily decisions about how we live our lives.\n",
      "I know this isn't the forum for that, and my opinion might be controversial, but: I'd like to add my perspective - I'm super skeptical on doctors prescribing me tons of meds to bandaid issues that should actually be addressed through lifestyle changes. US doctors are prescription-happy and it costs you not only money, but might hurt you further rather than heal you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acne cream is a great example here: do you want to pay $200/month to mask the issue, or would you rather make lifestyle changes to fix the underlying cause? Sure, there are some legitimate issues in our bodies that require medication, but a lot of times you can do yourself a huge favor by doing the labor of getting to the root cause rather than masking it with a drug.\n",

      "Any backbends where you are not relying on gravity or wall to do the bend are by definition strengthening - so, anything from laying on the belly (especially if not using hands) for example. Contortion discipline might be helpful to you - it's literally defined as 1) getting the flexibility and 2) getting the strength to do the contortion poses safely and consistently. Contortion focuses on a lot of strength building to have active flexibility (which is defined as unassisted range of motion) rather than passive flexibility (such as sitting in your splits or wheel pose passively).\n",

      "Air quality definitely varies by the region of LA, with beach cities getting consistently better quality than inland areas (duh). But my point was also that the setting itself of downtown LA is just not a place I could ever see as \"home\" because it's dirty, full of traffic, has pretty much no green space, and on top of everything else, housing there is expensive. Location is everything and as far as downtown goes, it's one of the worst ones IMO (commuting aside).\n",

      "While it makes sense to live in downtown to have little/no commute, I would get suffocated making that dirty concrete mess my home in addition to my work environment.

Because immigrants come here with nothing and work hard to get everything, rising despite their odds.

Rather than driving I would get a bicycle and a heavily discounted student monthly metro pass. Koreatown is really bad at parking so bike/bus/rideshaew is a lot better than owning a car. I would also try my best to get a place closer to a major supermarket and away from big street, and also make sure I don’t park my bike outside... it would get stolen quick (so I’d choose a lower floor or a building with an elevator).\n",

Basic premise is that we're not really conscious, or present, most of the time, but rather on autopilot, either thinking of the past or fantasizing of the future - so there's really not many memories that brain forms of the present moment. One of the exercises I began doing to help with sleep, but that also improved my awareness of passing time, is to \"rewind\" a day's worth of activities and happenings in my head, as if I'm rewinding a tape recorder, as I lay in bed before falling asleep. Aside from that, reflection through journaling and contemplation, as well as cutting out unhealthy influences (all of social media, TV news cycle, smartphone notifications, so on) really helped as well - but it's too easy to fall back to old habits, so it's a work in progress.\n",

      "What you need to do is overcome the initial bump of resistance and negative feelings associated with starting something new.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let's take running. If you decide to start running today, there's a chance that the first few days/weeks are going to SUCK. Your feet hurt because they're not used to it, you're short of breath, you don't know *where* to run or *how* to run or how to make it more enjoyable. But over time, your body gets used to it, you find cool spots to run, learn proper breathing technique, and soon enough begin to actually enjoy the benefits. However, if you don't stick around while your body and mind are adjusting to running, you won't get over that initial demotivational bump.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I suggest for you to pick a hobby or two and do them for a few weeks. As they say, throw some things on the wall and see what sticks. You don't have to like your first choices, but you do have to give them a chance. Even if you end up not keeping the hobby, you learn something about yourself and your interests in the process, and will choose better next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The important thing is to know about \"the bump\" and to never stop learning and picking up new things - unless, that is, you're so busy that you'll have to give something up to try something new. That, my friend, is the problem on the other side of the bump :)\n",
      "\n",
      "*P.S.* Of course, you also need to quit the things that are currently draining you mentally and emotionally - reddit, youtube, staying up late, etc. Just like quitting cigarettes or caffeine, first few days without are going to suck - you'll feel bored and in a constant need to check what's new online. That's your brain's reward system, gotten used to constant \"instant rewards\" provided by these websites, craving more. But eventually it'll subside and you'll realize just how silly it is to stare at the computer all day when there are so much better things to do outside... given that you picked up a few hobbies which you look forward to doing ;)\n",

Yoga is a combination of physical exercise ( asana ) that's pretty challenging both in terms of strength and flexibility , and exercise for the mind ( breath/pranayama , mindfulness ) . Yoga also slowly teaches you the basics of ancient philosophy of the mind originating from India and its surroundings that ended up answering a lot of questions for me . Yoga is all about self-study , physical and mental , and it's that awareness of self that ultimately brings you to self-acceptance , to realization of your strengths and weaknesses , and ultimately towards enlightment . Yoga community is also extremely beneficial to you - meeting other fit , happy people who practice kindness and seek out human connection is liberating . \n",

I highly recommend CorePower yoga chain or something similar - they blend the physical exercise nicely with light focus on mental aspects without completely alienating beginners ; their classes are also fun and challenging . Ultimately , shop around a handful of yoga studios ( most have very cheap introductory memberships ) and see if it is something that you enjoy .\n",

      "Why not try something else instead of continuing the same thing? Like yoga. I'm biased towards yoga because it gave me amazing results I never found at the gym with barbells and dumbbells. I still lift, but yoga has improved my mood tremendously (it's designed to do that after all), which allowed me to be more motivated and productive in other areas of my life. It also made me aware of the muscles in my body I didn't even know I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've lifted weights on-and-off for good 5 years but never saw the results due to lack of motivation, poor diet, mood, low energy, etc. So I thought I just suck at lifting but I kept limping along anyway.

I was immediately hooked - I felt amazing both physically and emotionally and of course I wanted more.\n",

      "Now it's been a solid 10 months without me missing a single day of yoga (it's usually first thing I do in the morning). I feel great and there's lots of definition in my body.

Bootcamps are just not my thing - and I came to realize that *there's nothing wrong with that.* If tons of people seemingly getting great results from CrossFit and you're not - don't beat yourself up!

Within the Buddhist tradition, [this] is sometimes referred to as 'falling into the Pit of the Void.' It entails an authentic and irreversible insight into Emptiness and No Self. Instead of being empowering and fulfilling … it turns into the opposite. In a sense, it's Enlightenment's Evil Twin.

In some cases, it takes months or even years to fully metabolize, but in my experience the results are almost always highly positive.\n",

Plus they've been accepting Bitcoin since way back.. and they've recently started offering SSD everywhere!\n",

      "Of course there's also the possibility of running the bot on my home desktop (I have a 16 GB RAM Ubuntu box with killer specs) but then I have to have my desktop run 24/7 and be afraid to do anything to it, so it's not worth the trouble.\n",

      ">Mindfulness is a tough job. It is an inherently solitary activity. One person battles against enormously powerful forces, part of the very structure of the mind doing the meditating. When you really get into it, you will eventually find yourself confronted with a shocking realization. One day you will look inside and realize the full enormity of what you are actually up against. What you are struggling to pierce looks like a solid wall so tightly knit that not a single ray of light shines through. You can find yourself sitting there, staring at this edifice, and you say to yourself, \"That? I am supposed to get past that? But it's impossible! That is what everything means, and that is what I use to define myself and to understand everything around me, and if I take that away the whole world will fall apart and I will die.

They have laid out the rules by which the job can be done, and they have banded together into a fellowship for mutual encouragement and support. The Buddha found his way through this very same wall, and after him came many others. He left clear instructions in the form of the Dhamma to guide us along the same path. And he founded the Sangha, the community of monks and nuns, to preserve that path and to keep each other on it. You are not alone, and the situation is not hopeless.\n",

      "As someone who was born in the USSR and whose parents have lived through most of its existence, I can say that the image Americans have of Soviet people and their life is pretty skewed to resemble today's totalitarian regimes like North Korea. This is far from the truth. Let me say that the standard of living of the average working-class Soviet worker was on par or better than that of a US worker (I don't have the data to back that up, just my observations - I live in the US now). USSR's founding principle was to put power into the hands of working people, and while this didn't literally occur, Soviet working class did get a lot of what US working class could only dream of.\n",

      "Life in USSR was pretty good right until the point of collapse. High-quality socialized education, medicine, summer camps, nearly guaranteed employment (and big opportunities in manufacturing, mining, sciences, farming..), and low inflation are all actually very nice - can you imagine getting all of these services for free, and them remaining top-notch? This is what Soviet people had, and believe me, they look back at those times with nostalgia today. It was because of the healthy economy and sectors I listed above the USSR was able to remain a superpower for so long, despite its shortcomings in other areas (such as diplomacy).\n",
      "\n",
      "The decline and collapse of USSR has been especially tough on the outlying republics, where every single service and item that used to be plentiful, quality, and free suddenly became scarce, defective, and very expensive. It's as if someone has taken a well-functioning body and cut it up in pieces. Today, life in Belarus, Uzbekistan, or Ukraine is especially bad - most of these smaller countries got overtaken by totalitarian governments that's extremely corrupt and doesn't do anything to promote economy or the good of the people - they're more interested in power and lining of their own pockets. Corruption might've been present during USSR reign, but it was heavily punished so it wasn't as rampant.

       " \"I’ve had my eye on this specific Mido since around Thanksgiving.  I didn’t want to pull the trigger until after all my holiday shopping was done to be somewhat responsible.  Jomashop had it listed for about $730 so when I was ready I was going to get it from there.  Time passed then last week on Monday night I realized I was completely ready.  So I checked everywhere, and to my surprise I found it on eBay for $550 OBO gently used.  I messaged the seller and found out some details, he bought it from an AD in September and it wasn’t getting any wrist time.  Then this happened:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/5loksv/mido_commander_ii_cosc_certified_chronometer/dbxaukz/?context=3\\n\\nThis post made me put in an offer for $500 even and I won!  Shipped Tuesday and it arrived Thursday.  There are some desk dive scratches on the bracelet, but hey I saved over 200 bucks on scratches I would have just made myself over the coming weeks.\\n\\nSince it’s a Chronometer, first order of business was testing its accuracy.  From Thursday to today, it’s an average of +4 seconds a day.  I think it’s more accurate when it’s under higher wind tension, so I’m going to reset it today fully wound instead of out of the box.  The 80 hour power reserve is the largest in my collection, and I LOVE how the sapphire is chamfered to make the top surface really pop.  I like a versatile color and grey really goes with everything I wear to my office job.   For my skinny wrist, I prefer 40mm and below, and this sits just right AT 40mm and the lugs are small so there's no overhang.  I’ve watched the date change, and it’s instantaneous at midnight which is something I always appreciate.  Overall, extremely happy with my purchase, and I would definitely recommend Mido as a brand up there with Oris to me in terms of value (I have an Oris 65).  It’s an incredible value for a Chronometer. \\n\",\n",

There are a few tells however. Sometimes on the dial font PANERAI will have the wrong spacing near the \"AI\" so PANER A I. Not that exagerated obviously.\\nCrown guards might not sit flush of have the correct shape. The crown guard lever will be shaped incorrectly.\\nThe Canon pin may not be rounded off correctly. Crown will sit flush against the case where most Gen Panerai will sit a few MM off the case and have a hexigon shaped tube. Crown teeth shaped incorrectly.\\n\\nThe Chinese take great steps in replication so the \"factories\" will continually come out with a new version V1,V2,V3 and so on correcting the pointed out flaws.\\nOn the current versions one must be very careful.\\nMost of the dials are now exact, Lume is great. Canon pins and crown guards have been properly shaped. Crystals are properly coated colorless. Proper Crown and tube with spacing. So how do you tell?\\nThey still do not have the movements replicated. Handcrankers still use a sticker for Officine Panerai and it is a give away. Another dead giveway is on the automatics. While the rotors have been replicated the bridges still have not. They will be marked but they will look like a normal everyday 2824 or such. They will not have the flat closed movement and proper marking of the CAl. P9000 for example. Even some of the Swan necks are wrong.\\nIf its coming down to you spending thousands I would, as others have said, have an AD look at it or at the very least open it up and ask your fellow freaks to take a look. I myself know of no properly replicated Panerai movement.\"\\n\\nYou might have to go back to the store to further inspect since the pics are hiding some things.\\n\\nGood luck!',\n",

Crown teeth shaped incorrectly.\\n\\nThe Chinese take great steps in replication so the \"factories\" will continually come out with a new version V1,V2,V3 and so on correcting the pointed out flaws.\\nOn the current versions one must be very careful.\\nMost of the dials are now exact, Lume is great.

They will not have the flat closed movement and proper marking of the CAl. P9000 for example.

Jomashop had it listed for about $730 so when I was ready I was going to get it from there.  Time passed then last week on Monday night I realized I was completely ready.  So I checked everywhere, and to my surprise I found it on eBay for $550 OBO gently used.  I messaged the seller and found out some details, he bought it from an AD in September and it wasn’t getting any wrist time.  Then this happened:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/5loksv/mido_commander_ii_cosc_certified_chronometer/dbxaukz/?context=3\\n\\nThis post made me put in an offer for $500 even and I won!  Shipped Tuesday and it arrived Thursday.  There are some desk dive scratches on the bracelet, but hey I saved over 200 bucks on scratches I would have just made myself over the coming weeks.\\n\\nSince it’s a Chronometer, first order of business was testing its accuracy.  From Thursday to today, it’s an average of +4 seconds a day.  I think it’s more accurate when it’s under higher wind tension, so I’m going to reset it today fully wound instead of out of the box.  The 80 hour power reserve is the largest in my collection, and I LOVE how the sapphire is chamfered to make the top surface really pop.  I like a versatile color and grey really goes with everything I wear to my office job.   For my skinny wrist, I prefer 40mm and below, and this sits just right AT 40mm and the lugs are small so there's no overhang.  I’ve watched the date change, and it’s instantaneous at midnight which is something I always appreciate.  Overall, extremely happy with my purchase, and I would definitely recommend Mido as a brand up there with Oris to me in terms of value (I have an Oris 65).  It’s an incredible value for a Chronometer. \\n\",\n",

This is far from the truth. Let me say that the standard of living of the average working-class Soviet worker was on par or better than that of a US worker (I don't have the data to back that up, just my observations - I live in the US now). USSR's founding principle was to put power into the hands of working people, and while this didn't literally occur, Soviet working class did get a lot of what US working class could only dream of.\\n\\nLife in USSR was pretty good right until the point of collapse. High-quality socialized education, medicine, summer camps, nearly guaranteed employment (and big opportunities in manufacturing, mining, sciences, farming..), and low inflation are all actually very nice - can you imagine getting all of these services for free, and them remaining top-notch? This is what Soviet people had, and believe me, they look back at those times with nostalgia today. It was because of the healthy economy and sectors I listed above the USSR was able to remain a superpower for so long, despite its shortcomings in other areas (such as diplomacy).\\n\\nThe decline and collapse of USSR has been especially tough on the outlying republics, where every single service and item that used to be plentiful, quality, and free suddenly became scarce, defective, and very expensive. It's as if someone has taken a well-functioning body and cut it up in pieces. Today, life in Belarus, Uzbekistan, or Ukraine is especially bad - most of these smaller countries got overtaken by totalitarian governments that's extremely corrupt and doesn't do anything to promote economy or the good of the people - they're more interested in power and lining of their own pockets. Corruption might've been present during USSR reign, but it was heavily punished so it wasn't as rampant. Today, you can forget about trying to get anything done with the government without bribing at each step of the process. Just about anyone who could leave the country has already done so.\\n\\nThis is why Russia has spent its 90's contemplating whether Communism should return, and even today Communist party has a minority in the government - it was a pretty good system that worked well though the 50's, 60's, and 70's - until the events of the 80's led to its collapse.\",\n",
