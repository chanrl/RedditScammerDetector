       "'Lord.\\n\\n\\nAs I\\'ve stated on other posts, I\\'ve done work for this gentleman before. \\n\\nAnd will do again if he needs me.\\n\\nI have been paid extremely promptly and the work is fast and easy as described. And yes, it\\'s legal. \\n\\n;) That\\'s because cheap food is unhealthy food. Stuff that\\'s good for you costs a freakin\\' fortune. Jesus H Christ on a kitten, THIS IS NOT A MOTHER EFFING EXPLOIT.\\n\\nThat dude who reported, I hope you whale and get MY relic luck for awhile for being so ridiculously dumb.\\n\\nHit & Run involves:\\n\\nEntering battle normally \\n\\nAttacking an enemy normally\\n\\nRunning away normally\\n\\nAnd repeating... again normally.\\n\\nThere is no exploit. There is no real \"trick\". It\\'s incredibly boring to do, but it can result in charging SB gauges as long as you can stomach doing it.\\n\\n**tl;dr H&R isn\\'t an exploit, anyone who thinks it is is a moron** Tell me how someone in this situation personally affects you?\\n\\n\\nSeriously, it doesn\\'t, so ignore it if it bothers you. Okay, here\\'s someone who ISN\\'T tagged saying it:\\n\\n\\nDane is 100% legit. Some of you might dislike him, but he\\'s not trying to play favorites and he\\'s certainly unlikely to abuse ANY position of authority.\\n\\n\\nSource?\\n\\n\\nI know him. He\\'s a friend, This is true. I\\'m not gonna deny that. This sort of thing  (task labor) is literally his job, and he\\'s not gonna take jobs he can\\'t do just to funnel them to those who can. That\\'s not how he operates. He will point posters toward people he knows are capable (which has been done a billion times before by others).\\n\\n\\nI\\'m pleased that a solution that erases even a hint of possible (but unfounded!) bias could be found. \\n\\n\\nAnd guys, if you don\\'t like him? You don\\'t have to interact with him. We\\'re adults. Please act like them.\\n\\nu/summerofsin  sorry to add to your feed but you should see This!\\n\\nMy hand hurts so I\\'m shutting up. :( This is beyond disgusting. How in the rainbow tinted FUCK can a person rationalize sexually abusing their own children and TAPING THAT SHIT FOR POSTERITY. \\n\\n\\nUuuuuggghhhh.  I\\'m pretty sure that one of the downvoted posters wasn\\'t trying to support the hospital\\'s decision in this case; I saw it as them saying \"I\\'m Catholic and this pissed me off too, but it is what it is.\"\\n\\nDisclaimer: I am in no way saying that that person is it is not correct in their statements. I am not Catholic. I am also not a lawyer. That said..\\n\\nI\\'m almost 100% certain that Catholic health institutions\\' right to not provide certain services is pretty limited, and that the exclusion usually applies to contraception, abortion, assisted suicide, and things like that. Things that they can do or not do.\\n\\nRecognizing  (or not!) an existing legal marriage is not included in a list of services they can claim is against their core beliefs. It isn\\'t a situation they can choose not to put into action; it\\'s a legal union recognized by both the state and the federal government. The staff may disapprove all they want, but denying rights of marriage isn\\'t legal and could get them into worlds of poo.\\n\\nI\\'d pleasantly ask to make an appointment with the hospital\\'s lawyer, informing them that I\\'d have my own at the meeting. Doing so may not help the immediate situation  (and for that I\\'m so sorry, thank God Texas was more progressive during my stepmom\\'s death) but it could help others  I\\'m interested, but not for myself, exactly.\\n\\nMy nine year old son has become interested in the game, and is actually rather good at it. He has a very new account, but it doesn\\'t have some of his favorite FF characters, like Auron, Tidus, or Lulu. He\\'s played several ff console games, but understandably wants to be powerful...and got zilch on his beginner draw.\\n\\nSo I\\'d like to toss me/him into the hat. A penis on an MTF transsexual. \\n\\n\\nJust like an FTM has a male vagina.  That\\'s kind of unfair, though.\\n\\nDownvote me to hell if you want, but some fake IDs are very convincing and some teenage girls look quite over 18. The gender assigned at birth.\\n\\n\\nDo you think for a minute that, regardless of crimes committed, it\\'s a good idea to house a transfemale in with male prisoners? \\n\\n\\nInB4: can\\'t do the time, don\\'t do the crime: I\\'m not advocating for a get out of jail free card, but it would be no different from housing a bio-female in with male prisoners.  They put me into third grade for half days when I was five. I suppose it was because I could read and write. All I remember was having to climb into the high seat for math.\\n\\nI don\\'t remember being quite on a fifth grade level, though. I\\'m fairly sure my mom smoked pot while pregnant; I know she definitely did when I was growing up.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible, just improbable.  Not true; I love well done steak and as former restaurant staff, I tip very well unless my server is total fail (almost never). Dude, it\\'s not illegal, or a cheat, or anything else. Running away is an allowed action.\\n\\nWhy in the nine blazing Hells did you feel the need to run and tell DeNa about this?! She looks like she\\'s biologically male. Not my post. Some other guy\\'s post. He was being a raging thundercunt and I was going to outline exactly why I thought that.  I do care about this subject because a good friend of mine is transgender and I feel sick at the hate he experiences just because of where he lives and the utter ignorance he\\'s subjected to. That makes me an interested party, so to speak.\\n\\n\\nSuggesting...no, outright SAYING that transgenderism is a mental illness IS hate, of a sort. Denying their basic self and suggesting psychiatric intervention is torture. Saying that torture is okay for a subset of people is hate. ^.^\\n\\n\\nJust one of the multiple ways we\\'re not each other- my kids would NEVER let me sleep from 5pm-9pm. That\\'s homework/video game/Mommy she\\'s LOOKING at me!! time.\\n\\n\\nGrats and condolences on modship! :D I\\'m not sure that you, or anyone else, has the right to say such an inane thing as \"your best isn\\'t good enough\".\\n\\n\\nWho died and made you the arbiter of human interaction?  You implied it.\\n\\n\\nPlease produce the multiple messages I sent with wild cursing or retract it.  I sent ONE MESSAGE with the word \"hell\" in it. Not multiple. Not going wild. I\\'m going to copy/paste the exact content but I\\'ll have to edit this post because I\\'m on mobile.\\n\\n\"Titled \"seriously\"\\n\\nYou know, instead of making a scene, you could simply ASK a person about their circumstances. \\n\\n\\nI\\'m slightly offended that you decided, apparently by yourself, to point fingers at me.\\n\\n\\nI can prove what I say is true. I resent the hell out of how you decided to investigate something innocent.\"\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s the \"going wild and swearing\". I never once sent any other messages. \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve never lied once to anyone. I possess ONE account. One. So I\\'m not sure where all this is coming from at all. If you\\'re going to accuse me of all this in public, I demand proof. This is insane. You haven\\'t let anything go if you\\'re blatantly lying about me in public.  You need to not tell me how I can and can\\'t feel. I will calm down after I\\'m over being angry.\\n\\n\\nI answered your legitimate questions and offered to show proof. That should have been the end of it- either ask for proof, I send it, end of story..... or just plain end of story.\\n\\n\\nInstead you opted for berating me and calling me names.  I think I\\'m done talking to you, as you\\'re determined to act unprofessionally toward me.  I posted this last night.\\n\\nThis morning, I received a phone call offering me a $75 Amazon card for a market research interview. Since my family literally has no income right now and I can prove this to moderators, I accepted the market research offer and then sold the gift card for money for supporting the family.\\n\\n\\nIf anyone takes issue with me doing this, then I\\'m sorry. When I made the request here I was unaware that I\\'d be receiving anything from anyone until my scheduled task later this month. It\\'s not my intent to attempt to gain unwarranted assistance, nor did I delete My giftcardexchange post; it was removed due to a formatting error, As records will show. I was retyping it and waiting the time limit to repost  as another user messaged me to purchase it (which can also be proven via timestamp).\\n\\n\\nIf I was attempting to hide it, as this little inquisition feels like, I wouldn\\'t have posted it at all. I\\'m sorry if this offends anyone by my wording, but to my knowledge u/rhubes is not a moderator here and has had discussions with me of an interrogatory nature on my old unsuccessful  /r/assistance post. \\n\\n\\nIf anyone has any questions or wishes me to furnish proof to mod staff I\\'m completely willing.\\n\\n\\nTo my benefactor: thank you for your help, if I\\'d known I was getting this I\\'d never have posted, and if you wish I will repay you directly when I\\'m able. Have done this, it\\'s not fun.\\n\\nI\\'m that crazy bitch who did 300 Bahamut JS on speed 4, though. I call her Yishie. Liar. Greg with Repentance and Faithful Companion\\n\\nPecil with Saint\\'s Fall \\n\\nLeon with HotE\\n\\n Tifa with Dolphin Blow \\n\\nQuistis with MG\\n\\n Garnet with Leviathan (...lol) and DG\\n\\n Ashe with Heavens Wrath\\n\\n Eiko with Flames of Rebirth\\n\\nGolbez with Nightglow\\n\\nVivi with Doublecast Decay \\n\\nAerith with Pulse of Life\\n\\nTyro with SLG and Celebration \\n\\nPenelo with War Dance\\n\\nZidane with Scoop Art\\n\\nThat might be it, I have waaay too many medicas and my summons, being r3 ones because I only started 3ish months ago, are not dealing crap. Cag resists Holy so my usual tactic of beating the shit out of things with Saint\\'s Fall isn\\'t an option. My Agrias is level 33 and I have no unique for her, but I could probably level her up if that could help.  Since it\\'s a ranged fight, can you still use Indomitable Blade without losing medals?  Strategy Name : Tank and Spank\\n\\nEnemies : Fujin, Raijin, and That Whiny Little Bitch  (...I loathe Seifer) Ultimate \\n\\nStrategy- Cecil is a brick wall, of sorts. Capitalize on Lionheart and Draw Fire shenanigans. Greg is useful in a way my spellblades are not- I have his SSB and Jumps!\\n\\nInsights- My God, Fujin nukes like a madwoman.

This ranks right up there with antivaxers to me.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bathroom.\\n\\nWe\\'re in there to relieve ourselves, (hopefully) wash hands, and gtfo. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure what peril is implied from having a transgender person in the bathroom, but people need to just fucking stop.\\n\\nI have kids.

NAL, but have personal experience from the other side.\\n\\nMy eldest son has Asperger\\'s, and thus strange concepts of personal boundaries. One day while playing on the playground, he put his hands down another (male) student\\'s pants, which quite understandably upset the other child. \\n\\nBefore you say it, no, I\\'m definitely not defending my kid\\'s actions in ANY way, Aspie or not.\\n\\nThe school threatened to suspend my son, ultimately deciding against it, but he was put into therapy and he wasn\\'t allowed near the other child for quite some time. He ended up writing the other big an apology letter, something I approved of him doing, and has since come to realize just what he did.\\n\\nPerhaps a meeting is in order, with your xhild, yourself, the other child and their guardian, the school counselor and the principal. Sometimes children with disabilities don\\'t realize how things hurt others, and must be shown in a way they can grasp. The kid with Downs should definitely not be excused- most children with Downs are perfectly capable of understanding social rules and abiding by them. He shouldn\\'t be labeled as a sex offender, either. \\n\\nGetting the law involved before taking these steps could be really ugly for all involved.\\n\\nMy 0.02 None of my kids ate baby food after the cereals.

Full disclosure: I\\'m banned from there because I defaulted on a loan. I took it out before my spouse was forced onto medical leave and then denied unemployment. I\\'ve been supporting a family of six on r/slavelabour money.\\n\\n\\nSo that\\'s impossible.  Stop what behavior, asking for you to produce proof of what you\\'re accusing me of?\\n\\n\\nNo. You directly stated above  (unless you edited it) that I had sent you multiple messages with cursing and \"going wild\". I admit to a single use of the word \"hell\" and one message.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t appreciate the way you\\'re attempting to make me look bad, and I don\\'t believe that asking for proof of accusations is against the rules of any sub that I know of. And if you ban me for \"refusing to accede to the wishes of modstaff\" because I refuse to stop asking you to kindly retract the accusations or prove it, I\\'m going to find some way to ensure accountability.\\n\\n\\nNow, since you\\'ve said that I sent one message in your unprofessionally worded last statement, I\\'ll let this alone. I maintain that you have let your personal dislike of me to affect you as a mod. That\\'s not good. \\n\\n\\n Not one nearby, but when I have to drive my husband to the city I go right past one.

Verified is worth a tad more than  $5, if only because of the personal info involved in verification...\\n\\n\\nPlus, you can\\'t have your own anymore.\\n\\n I\\'ve been in your position. It totally sucks to have a mouth-ache constantly, feeling sick from the constant infection and feeling sicker because of the OD on otc painkillers that don\\'t do much. Being poor and in pain sucks. Then there\\'s not being able to smile. Yeah, I\\'ve been there. \\n\\n\\nI suggest calling individual dentists and asking about an extraction. Some will work with you. I\\'m pretty sure CareCredit isn\\'t an option for you; it wasn\\'t for me either. \\n\\n\\nSome emergency rooms can do emergency extraction. Those that don\\'t might be able to do a temporary nerve block. I don\\'t know how you feel about ER bills, though. Mouth infections can be dangerous in rare cases. People have died from infections that began as toothache. Getting antibiotics I\\'d important, and they might give you something for the pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can buy clove oil in a Toothache Emergency kit sold at most drugstores. It tastes like dead monkey ass, but it does temporarily relieve the pain. The kit comes with cotton balls that can be placed directly into a cavity or cracked area. \\n\\n\\n\\nI pulled a tooth myself once out of desperation. Don\\'t do this. It frigging HURT, and I left fragments. \\n\\n\\nIn the end I got all my teeth pulled because of a program that helps the disabled in my state. My psychologist recommended me and they did the work. \\n\\n\\nI hope you can get relief.

Burn your arm off. Burn the other arm off too. It is hard to read people online... I have a hard enough time doing it in person, let alone through a screen.\\n\\nRegarding any history, feel free to ask.\\n\\nDrive/fly safely. When I was asst manager at the... uh, Awful Mouse... we had an older lady waitress everyone called Miss Jean. She\\'d stare her customers down and hold her hand out: \"Did you forget something?!\" Yeah, Yeah, soliciting tips is usually not allowed, but she did it to the regulars and this is an exceedingly casual environment.  I had a foot long post dedicated to explaining what i thought of a particular attitude but the post has been removed.\\n\\nSo I\\'ll just give general advice:\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to tip your server, eat at home. Chances are, no matter what\\'s stated in the contract, you\\'re going to be encouraged, pressed, or otherwise threatened into not taking your breaks.\\n\\nThey will then point to the signed contract and gasp in shock if you attempt legal remedies, because an employer would never, EVER do that, it says so in the contract! \\n\\nSituations like this one almost never favor or end well for the employee. And if this is created, somebody somewhere will DIE because they can\\'t afford the cure.\\n\\nA vaccine/cure would be a wonderful thing. I\\'m not against that at all. I\\'m against corporate profitmongering at the expense of human life. \\n\\nNobody ever should be denied treatment essential to continued existence because of money. I don\\'t know the whole story; none of us do unless we were there.\\n\\n\\nI thank you for the appreciation, as you\\'re right: I don\\'t judge based on things like that.\\n\\n\\nIF she was indeed profiled then that, of course, is reprehensible. Commenting to state that doggie food arrived today, but since it\\'s raining said doggies are holed up somewhere and won\\'t come out, not even for yummies. \\n\\n\\nNice FedEx Guy carried the box all the way to my back porch for me when I almost fell over when he handed it over. :)\\n\\n\\nThank you once again. You\\'re awesome, u/Idontbelieveintime.  You\\'re probably right, but I\\'d think that such behavior would at least warrant a bit of investigation besides just asking the alleged perpetrator and his  (likely pissed off too) wife. That\\'s kind of their job. No, it\\'s just a \"system\" where you earn your $47/day by suckering other people into buying this same \"So easy system\" that you\\'re pushing now. \\n\\n\\n\\nYuck. \\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe not an outright scam, but it\\'s misleading and utterly scuzzy. My \"lawn\" is two acres, including trees.\\n\\n\\nThat said, it\\'s usually behind the Propane tank. Not to the extent that most other people do, nope!\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re using this argument as an excuse to hate what\\'s different. \\n\\n\\nBeing transgender is absolutely not a mental illness. The fact that you seem to think that it is makes me laugh at the idiocy of that belief. (Note that I didn\\'t call YOU an idiot. I\\'m disputing and insulting the belief, not he who holds it.)\\n\\n\\nI do wish that people who believe as you do could, for just a single day, experience what a transgendered person experiences. ....is that her taking a LEG? You\\'re a very rare user?\\n\\n\\nAre you referring to your username  (Sylveon isn\\'t rare, not even if it\\'s shiny) or is that a slightly inflated sense of self importance I sense? ....oh my god thank you I\\'ll pay pet tax when I can Round up the fuzzfaces  For those who may want to know:\\n\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure that the OP gets a referral credit if you do this survey and qualify for the $25 using this link.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, it\\'s only open to those who purchase their own insurance through an exchange NOT FROM EMPLOYER.\\n\\n\\n Updated, enjoy my 250+ MND Shout. The person who posted it is a dyed in the wool moron.  What in the actual fuck.  I know right? My gorgeous but broke daughter might contaminate the rich girls and they\\'ll... they\\'ll... catch POOR! OH GOD I DIDN\\'T THINK OF THAT\\n\\n<3 My daughter is eleven, so absolutely not. Transgender doesn\\'t mean you can break the law.\\n\\n\\nThey\\'ll house her with prisoners of her bio-gender, though, which usually doesn\\'t end well. If you don\\'t have kitty soap and the kitten is really dirty or has heavy flea infestation, you can use Dawn dish soap. \\n\\nObviously, don\\'t use a lot, and try to keep it off eyes/noses/mouths, but it really works. I had a white cat who snuck outside and parked himself under a car...a leaky car...so when I found him my white cat was a black cat.\\n\\nDawn cleared the motor oil right off. My kids (11,9,9, and 5) are all aware that different people love differently and all forms are okay. \\n\\nThe three eldest are aware of my bisexuality, and I\\'m as honest about it as they need me to be. I\\'ve also been asked about how same-sex couples can have families, and answered that as well. I\\'m honest withy kids, they\\'re gonna learn it someplace and I\\'d rather it be from their parents than some possibly misinformed kid on the school bus.\\n\\nThere is less than no point in teaching children that loving ANYONE is wrong in a consensual, healthy relationship.  Because selling the car you need to maintain employment so you aren\\'t forced to be homeless makes SO MUCH SENSE.\\n\\nYou\\'re showing distinct signs of craniorectal inversion. Hope you have insurance for that.  I gotta ask:\\n\\nWhy in the FUCK would someone bleach their asshole? That would be pretty hard as we signed a contract with the dealership, and thus owe them the balance. It\\'s also building credit.\\n\\nI don\\'t deny that the personalfinance folks would be helpful. They would be, I\\'m Sure, but they can\\'t solve the immediate problem. The long-term is something we\\'re trying to work on, but it will be impossible to do so if my husband gets fired because he can\\'t go to work.\\n\\nWe can\\'t afford to buy a cheap car right now. I\\'m begging online to strangers to assist in financing the TT&L of the one we have.... I definitely don\\'t have the money to buy another car.\\n\\nNote: if my tone seems rude, I honestly don\\'t mean to be...  I have issues and one of them is an inability to gauge tone/emotive content and the like. That makes me appear cold, robotic, or rude when I do not mean it.\\n\\nI\\'m being as open and factual as possible with everyone. Luckily, downvotes don\\'t bother me. \\n\\nIt\\'s already become apparent that Reddit is likely not the place for me to attempt my fundraising. I\\'m not sure why people are criticising me for wanting reliable transportation. We need it. Like I\\'ve said, public transportation does not exist here. Walking is out of the question. Switching jobs to somewhere within walking distance isn\\'t an option because that would involve a significant pay cut. \\n\\nWe need this car. We need to get it legal as fast as we can.  I just called the tag office for the state... the office nearest my house.\\n\\nBallpark estimate because it\\'s the first time tagging it:\\n\\n$850.\\n\\nSo the Cherokee Nation is definitely going to be the way to go. The dmv.org site figure is most definitely not accurate. They did, however, have very accurate phone numbers.\\n\\n\\n\\n We were going through the Cherokee Nation. They have always been cheaper than the state  \\n\\nThe fee as I recall it for a 2006 Lexus with an exempt odometer  was $234 (...i think that was the exact number) plus penalties due to lateness. It\\'s been a month, and we haven\\'t been able to scrape up the funds because the family has to have power, food, gas to go to work... \\n\\nThe fees cannot exceed twice the tag costs and cap after 30 days. I asked for $500 because I fully expect for that to be the cost based upon previous experience. \\n\\nWe are on food stamps already, I\\'m in the loooooong process of getting disability, we\\'ve explored all loan companies in the area, and I\\'ve shared my campaign on my Facebook wall. I signed up for LIHEAP for the electric bill but they ran out of funding. \\n\\nI asked churches, the Cherokee Nation, and I\\'m really thinking that at this point I\\'m unlikely to get assistance of any sort, because of my limited contacts and inability to work outside the home.\\n\\nI\\'ve sold pretty much everything I can sell, my phone is a freebie from True Wireless  (lifeline), and now the kids are out of school so there\\'s an increased food consumption issue. I always eat last, because I\\'m the mother.\\n\\nIf you have any more questions I\\'ll be happy to answer.\\n\\n Before I got all my teeth pulled, I was in daily agony. \\n\\nYes, agony. I grew up poor, like food bank every week getting utilities turned off poor, and there just wasn\\'t options for me to receive dental care, because food was more important. \\n\\nAs a result, I have very little jawbone remaining. I\\'m 36 years old and can\\'t afford dentures that fit, so people continually insinuate that I\\'m a meth user. \\n\\nMy immune system is wrecked because of having an almost constant mouth infection for literally years. I called and begged countless dentists for help, and nobody would.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t just affect your physical health; it screws your mental health, too, because of society\\'s insistence upon judging people based on looks.\\n\\nSo my explanation is simple, based on experience: if you\\'re poor, you\\'re basically screwed. It\\'s about money. Insurance companies don\\'t want to pay for anything they\\'re not forced to pay for. Since one can live without teeth (or glasses) they consider it a nonessential service. BRB, just barfed in my mouth a little. I had an under the car hood kitty myself! No idea where she came from, just a little scrap of tabby kitten that mewed her way into her forever home.\\n\\n She was beautiful then, and you can still see that in her face now. \"Stately\" is a good word to describe her.\\n\\nAs for royalty being innately superior, lolno. They generally don\\'t feel that way. It\\'s a tradition and there\\'s nothing wrong with it.  That honestly depends. The service would have had to be terrible AND definitely the server\\'s fault  (don\\'t blame your server for kitchen issues) for me not to tip. Even then I\\'d probably leave *something*. Tips are the wages.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re not forced to tip. You re not forced to eat at a restaurant, either, so those are choices you can make. Some states are like that, you earn regular minimum wage in addition to tips. I did in Minnesota, for example. \\n\\nStill, tips for good service are appreciated and it\\'s the best way to indicate your opinion of the service. The number of people that understand \"merge\" and \"yield\" are depressingly small. That\\'s not just property damage; if someone is beating on my door with a friggin\\' baseball bat it\\'s not unreasonable to gather that the person might intend to use that bat on my head if I opened the door. IANAL but a direct expression of violence intended to intimidate is assault, no?\\n\\n\\nUnless I\\'m missing my mark here.... such assault is DEFINITELY a police matter that should be investigated. \\n\\n\\nEdit: phrasing  You could try calling Animal Control. How is it optional when my childrens\\' school expects free access to Google and their special educational sites? \\n\\nNo, having a computer and basic internet is pretty much required if you have kids in school, especially when you live in BFE like I do. \\n\\nProblem is, getting internet out here is either satellite or a cell phone hotspot. It\\'s cheaper to use my phone, so a cell phone is necessary as well. We won\\'t even discuss our only local phone company. I have a landline through them. Across the street is long distance, and it\\'s not any real distance away. \\n\\nThis phone co. only offers dial-up....in 2016.\\n\\nWelcome to Nowhere, folks. I showed this to my two sons, who actually can play Halo without making kittens cry.\\n\\n\\nThey concur.\\n\\n\\nRelated- having kids of split ages means that the youngest will sometimes know a LITTLE too much for her age. My horde are age 12 to almost 7. \\n\\n\\n*incoming thunder of feet, I look up*\\n\\n\\nMy oldest has Aspergers and gets upset fairly easily over things, even small things. He\\'s running just ahead of two of the others- 11yo son and 6yo daughter. They\\'re both telling him to calm down, which has the opposite effect  (and kids being little snots sometimes,  is something they occasionally do on purpose.)\\n\\n\\nI tell all three to put a sock in it and ask what on God\\'s green earth happened. I\\'m envisioning all sorts of indignities when he stares at me and says,\\n\\n\\n\"MOOOOOOMMMM Serah killed me four times in a row in Halo and SHE TEABAGGED ME!\"\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s because you suck.\" 11yo smartass son adds helpfully. \\n\\n\\nHe probably wasn\\'t too happy when his dear mother couldn\\'t stop laughing after that...\\n Reply to note: I don\\'t blame the little girl. She got to play princess and be on TV and was too young to think of the consequences. Poor kid. That actually made me giggle. I\\'m the mother of fraternal twins, and one is left handed.\\n\\nHe\\'s the odd one, too. He\\'s been a pain since before he was born  (had cord issues this necessitating a cesarean).\\n\\nMaybe he ate a triplet! After reading this and other forums for pharmacists and pharmacy techs, I have learned to be a lot more polite and understanding of the processes that must occur before I get my monthly prescriptions.\\n\\nMy pharmacist knows me by name now, and I never rush her or her techs.

Most companies, including Walmart, send them out and do absolutely nothing if the letters are ignored.\\n\\n\\nSome do take it further, but you\\'ll be notified if they do. The chances are fairly high that you won\\'t hear back from them.  My question here is this:\\n\\n\\nWhat stops these companies from shifting the original debt just to circumvent Fair Debt Collection practices? It seems to me that though the letter of the law is satisfied, the spirit of it has been shredded into pieces.\\n\\n\\nThough, since the SCOTUS issued that opinion it\\'s doubtful that anyone cares.  What he said.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, since he\\'s such an asshat of a repo Guy, if he happens to come by your home or especially place of business, make certain that you remember this: in Virginia he may not \"breach the peace\" even when conducting a legitimate repossession. I understand that they should either get the money or the car, but anyone who claims that they\\'re effectively judge, jury, and the Commonwealth Attorney shouldn\\'t be permitted to do it easily (IMO).  The power of Google compels you! Appeal on both counts has been filed and we\\'re awaiting the appeal date. They already have a three page statement from his NP (not his doctor, because the wait list to see him is interminable). He has an upcoming appointment with his pain management doctor in two weeks, though, and I\\'m willing to doubt that the hearing date will be before that.\\n\\n\\nDocumentation in excess of the statement supplied will be sent before the hearing,  for certain. \\n\\n\\nThe issue with this is that it\\'s likely to be held telephonically (is that a word?) since we\\'re not close to OKC. The person who had direct knowledge of, and sanctioned, my husband\\'s restrictions is his manager, who would not likely be appearing. I was considering asking the hearing Office to subpoena him, because then he couldn\\'t refuse to testify easily. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Your username is so fitting for a sub dedicated to legal matters. Pet tax paid, minus Max, No idea where he is right now. \\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8y6v6 I\\'m in contact with my giver via PM. I\\'ve also given no reason for a ban, unless there\\'s a \"discretion\" reason. I answered everything publicly as well, offering proof. This was never asked for. \\n\\n\\nI\\'m not the one who decided to post a message in reply to my giver with questionable phrasing when describing me after I had dropped the situation. \\n\\n\\nYou did. \\n\\n\\nSo yeah, when it\\'s a personal attack, I\\'m going to take it personally and call you out just as publicly as you did to me.  No, I\\'m asking that you not attempt to sensationalize  (\"swearing through pm\" without context nor actual severity) my words and frankly I find it incomprehensible that you would call me childish for asking for fairness, which I honestly don\\'t feel I\\'ll get from you.\\n\\n\\nAbrasive I\\'ll own up to. I tend toward it, especially when I feel like someone is chasing after me without good reason. I feel the need to defend myself when a moderator calls me out in a public forum in which I am unknown.\\n\\n\\nPeople are free to question me and I\\'ll answer. I\\'ve answered your questions. I will reach out directly to the kind person who donated to me and explain the situation. I will NOT sit here and allow you, personally, to attempt to ascribe some ulterior motive to everything I say. \\n\\n\\nWhat I mean is just that: if anyone is asking me questions as a moderator in an official capacity, I request someone other than you as I am under the impression that you will not view my responses and proof impartially. \\n\\n\\nYou said you helped me in that thread. Correction: you said you\\'d like to and would return later. You never did. I don\\'t hold that against you; I would never obligate someone to help me. Please don\\'t make things more than they are, though- that statement, on face value, makes you look good while your other statements, similarly on face value, make me look like crap. I\\'m abrasive and imperfect and probably a whole lot of other words but I don\\'t scam for donations and I resent LIKE HOLY HECK the implication that I am (by the original post). I\\'m sorry if you call \"resent like hell\" swearing.  Way to sensationalize things, though! \\n\\n\\nEdit: Note that I said \"to my knowledge\". \\n\\n\\nYour attitude toward me seems to be prejudicial and if this has to be handled by staff at all (it really shouldn\\'t) I\\'m formally requesting that someone else please do so. \\n\\n\\nThank you.

This is a very real study and extremely easy; I completed it yesterday and received my gift card almost immediately. https://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=6672740\\n\\n\\nPrizeRebel offers surveys, offerwalls, videos, and other tasks for points. 1 point = $0.01  QuickThoughts is a great app, it pays out in Amazon cards only for Android. I think it does iTunes if you\\'re on iOS. You can earn a decent amount fairly quickly and most surveys are worth  $1.\\n\\n\\n1Q doesn\\'t have a ton of questions yet, but it pays instantly to PayPal and is fairly unobtrusive. \\n\\n\\nGoogle Opinion Rewards pays in Google Play credit, and is relatively decent. \\n\\n\\nAll of these can be found in the Play store. $bid\\n I do know that a lot of the time these are a scam. They\\'ll send you a fake cashier\\'s check and tell you to buy supplies from their authorized retailer. \\n\\n\\nI contacted a company about this before and that\\'s what happened to me. I called the bank that the check was drawn from and confirmed that it wasn\\'t real. \\n\\n\\nThen the guy who sent it to me kept blowing up my email and finally threatened to call the cops on me for \"keeping his money\". I invited him to do so, telling him that I\\'d forwarded the check and his contact info to his local cops already  (I hadn\\'t).\\n\\n\\nHe left me alone after that. There\\'s a newsletter you can subscribe to, Top Class Action Lawsuits, that lists things like this as well as other class actions that you may unknowingly qualify for.\\n\\n\\nThey don\\'t spam you, it\\'s once per week.

I don\\'t use CL much where I live because it\\'s pretty sparse unless I drive 50+ miles to the metro area. \\n\\n\\nYard sales, on the other hand...\\n\\n\\nI\\'m a yard sale junkie and I tend to go for older video games, jewelry, and tech items... I rarely find the latter except in the form of a truckload of worthless old cell phones, most of which are branded for US Cellular and therefore carrier-locked without jailbreak. \\n\\n\\nI have gotten a near new 10\" Acer tablet for $20 and a Kindle Fire for  $15. I didn\\'t resell those; I kept the Kindle and my dad kept the tablet. \\n\\n\\nI buy collectible and rare video games from moms innocently getting rid of their kid\\'s old stuff quite often. I sell those to my local used game shop, who then makes his money. He\\'s VERY generous with trades, offering 75% of his store selling price to me in credit or 50% in cash. Since he\\'s an independent, I also know that I\\'m helping support him over GameStop  (ewww) and we\\'re all making money. \\n\\n\\nWell, I guess the yard sale holders make money... just not MUCH, because if they tell me that PS2 games are $5 each and I find stuff I\\'m gonna get  $50 for, I\\'m not telling them that. \\n\\n\\nI smile, pay them, and wait until I\\'ve driven away before I cheer out loud.  What\\'s the chances that this will be even worth the data used to download and maintain the app if you live in a very rural area?\\n\\n\\nMy first guess is that it will be like Pokemon GO and end up useless to me, but I figure it\\'s worth asking about.  *Ten days* to clear a check? Or pay a fee similar to a B&M check cashing store....\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s worse than PayPal. \\n\\n\\nHell, that\\'s as bad as that Amex Serve card that Jackson Hewitt tries to force on everybody. Those people worship the God \"Seven-to-ten-business-days\" and woe betide the heretic who questions it.\\n\\n\\nIf I get a random check i care little about I\\'ll give it a shot, though, because free money.\\n\\n\\nHow long do I have to submit a check before the offer expires? If you swap spit on a regular basis, using each others\\' tooth brushes isn\\'t really a stretch. So it\\'s account creation and not funding? \\n\\n For customer service? \\n\\n\\nCS is similar across the board in almost every field imaginable. A hint of deference in your voice to management and customer, making sure you don\\'t speak too loudly or forcefully. \\n\\n\\n\"Good morning. My name is X and I\\'ll be glad to assist you.\" Other industry specific phrases follow, but in general that will serve you well.\\n\\n\\n\"If you could tell me your issue, let\\'s see what we can do to fix it.\" Again, industry specific phrases work with this general idea. For example,  a call center would gather necessary info in a courteous and empathetic manner, ensuring that the tone used conveyed emotions since visual display isn\\'t possible. \\n\\n\\n\"Is there anything else I could assist you with this morning/today/afternoon/evening?\" Using the time of day shows a customer that their time is important. \\n\\n\\nSource For this mess: I\\'ve worked far too many CS jobs.\\n\\n\\nI\\'d also recommend that you record yourself as practice to ensure the right tone and timbre.\\n\\n\\nEditsauce- File format can be almost any; they\\'ll be able to use it on a standard Windows system as long as you are using standard Windows apps.  \\n\\nLength...

Key words here: \\n\\nWaiting list\\n\\nThey\\'ll email you when it\\'s your turn. They had an overwhelming turnout and will get to you. I\\'ve received my order from my promo and my husband got an email stating that he was in the wait list and another asking a few extra questions to secure his spot.\\n\\nCheck your spam folders for emails, folks, mine went there initially.\\n\\nThey sent me an email today asking me to rate them in a ten second process. I did so because they gave me $25 for doing almost nothing. The secret shopping panels that hire you expressly do NOT want you directly sharing your experiences as a shopper with them. \\n\\nThey would not be pleased if you were to be caught doing so. Every secret shopping company I\\'m contracted with  (3-4) specifically states that you\\'re not to ever identify yourself as a shopper to the company you shopped.  Giving too many inconsistent answers to demographic questions  (lowering quality score) or being caught using/appearing to use a VPN to get around their rules. \\n\\nAt least, those are the most common reasons. Getting caught blatantly lying might be another but I\\'m unsure as to how they\\'d even know.\\n\\nWhat I want to know: what if someone actually DID have breakfast with the Queen, ate their shoes for dinner, or suffered from dyshousia  (...painful house I guess?) Then what?? The higher your quality score represents consistency with your answers to demographic questions.\\n\\nYourSurveys isn\\'t stupid, they know people lie like rugs for credits.  Emailed.  QuickThoughts is indeed on the play app store and is remarkably legit regarding its surveys.  Thank you kindly! I already got an invitation from the last batch, a $15 One for recording my voice.  Depends on the MMORPG to be honest. \\n\\nLots of people do this though even if it\\'s against the game\\'s TOS. Just don\\'t get caught, and beware of chargebacks from disgruntled buyers who get banhammered for cheating. Payment received, a pleasure to work with. Thank you sir. Thank you for your help! No, all I did was log in to my account on the business debit card landing page and it said: \"You re preapproved, click here if you want a card!\" (Paraphrased)  Thank you. I have a verified account so I imagine it won\\'t be difficult to swap it. How do you get a business debit card? I got the first half of my Walmart order today.\\n\\nDaughter loves her dress and free jolly ranchers really do taste better than usual! They have a PayPal prepaid debit card  (MasterCard) that you can get. It has a monthly fee, which sucks, but no transaction fees and you can immediately transfer PayPal funds to it for free. I mainly use my phone and I can\\'t check anything on it.\\n\\nI\\'ve received emails from Walmart stating that my order has been shipped,  with tracking numbers for both parts, so I\\'m gonna assume that tomorrow I\\'ll be getting a package and the other will arrive next week. No problem! I just re-read the first four books do it stuck in my head.\\n\\nThank *you* for not being offended by the tone; I wasn\\'t trying to be rude/pedantic and I\\'m glad you didn\\'t get upset. Wrong book. It was from the first one, because that\\'s where Mirri Maaz Duur appears. Other servers can be straight up bitches about sections/tables/rotation..... It\\'s ridiculous.  I do these things too. As former wait staff, I can tell the difference between me not getting refills/whatever because it\\'s just you on the floor and you\\'re getting your ass kicked... And me not getting those things because you\\'re texting in station 3.\\n\\nI also pre-bus. Everything stacked neatly and in an easy to carry fashion. Plus, I wipe up my own little messes...\\n\\n When I started waiting tables, I asked the same question. \\n\\nThe reply?\\n\\n\"Retraining for three weeks (Min. Wage while training). If you still can\\'t make enough tips to equal minimum wage after that, you will be let go for poor job performance.\" I signed up Monday. Does that translate into \" nobody is getting $300 (or so) in currency in the near future simply by signing up and referring people to your site? \\n\\nNo offense, but straight answers would be appreciated. Your words lead me to believe that the \"1,050 days of logging in\" another user joked about might be closer to the truth than we initially  thought. \\n\\nThank you in advance for your reply. :) After you sign up and confirm your email (don\\'t forget this step) you\\'ll be placed on a waiting list. Then you sit tight.\\n\\nThey will send you an email when it\\'s time for you to do your beta test. Download the extension whenever you like- you have the option to do so shortly after you confirm your email. \\n\\nMake sure to check your spam folder, especially gmail, because that\\'s where at least two of my shop.co emails went. Once you flag one as not spam, though, they\\'ll hit your inbox.\\n\\nIf you have any questions they have a support ticket system that\\'s available. Update!\\n\\nMy Walmart order has shipped!\\n\\nGood luck with your orders and folks:\\n\\nDON\\'T FORGET TO WAIT UNTIL YOU\\'VE RECEIVED YOUR INVITE EMAIL. IF YOU RUSH INTO IT YOU WILL NOT GET THE PROMO CREDIT.\\n\\n^.^ Little girl isn\\'t flying her birdie!  If I cuss you out and call you a worthless scumsucking sack of worm shit is that worth  $20?\\n\\nJ/K Please don\\'t message me. They aren\\'t trying to mine for CC data; most companies wouldn\\'t commit federal crimes under the guise of creating a new way to shop online. Especially since their support team is transparent about location and communication. \\n\\nMy guess is that the VCC site you used is associated with fraudulent activity in general; a lot of people use stuff like that for less than aboveboard reasons. Or that there was a discrepancy in name/billing address/etc.\\n\\nAll that said, my order has NOT been cancelled, and I look forward to getting my stuff. I chose items not eligible for in store/site to store so I\\'m really not sure.\\n\\nIt\\'d be cool if you can, though!\\n\\nI\\'m guessing not, though, because shop.co seems to handle the shipping end through the add-on, and I never saw an option within the add-on. My receipt showed it was paid by gift card. I dont know how to upload an image somewhere to show it.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry you\\'re having difficulty.  It\\'s legit. I\\'ve ordered and received the survey link for post-order. \\n\\nPatience, folks. Check your order confirmation email to see what paid the total. If you ended up paying for it yourself then they SHOULD reimburse you via gift card.\\n\\nUnless you didn\\'t get your email telling you to install the add-on; You actually have to have that before you\\'re considered part of the test  group and therefore eligible for the promo.\\n\\nThey have customer service also. You can try asking them. The credit is applied during checkout. I know for a fact that I paid nothing because the card I have on file has about $0.30 on it. They sell nothing on their site \\n\\nIt\\'s a tool for use on other sites.\\n\\n You hAve to wait for your invite email. It\\'s kinda slow. Remember that this is a beta test and the reason why they\\'re throwing money at you to test it. I got a confirmation email from both shop.co and Walmart about my order. As far as I know the order, using the test credit, must be under $25 including tax and shipping to go through. I\\'m in total agreement with the OP. Thank you, pharmacists, for not judging.\\n\\nThank you for ensuring I get the right medicines.\\n\\nThank you for the times you go above and beyond. \\n\\nThank you for doing your job, cause I know it\\'s usually thankless.  Yep, it almost feels like I robbed them. The survey they send you is short, but they gave me  $25 worth of Walmart stuff so I was very wordy in exchange. @everyone please read my post at the top of the screen about your promo credit, I\\'ll TLDR it here though:\\n\\nYOU DO NOT SEE A CREDIT IT\\'S APPLIED TO YOUR $25 OR LESS ORDER WHEN YOU CHECK OUT USING THE SHOP.CO CART.\\n\\nThat said, I got a cool email this morning containing my survey after my successful order last night. It had my survey in it. If I get my go-ahead to refer people I\\'ll give my email so we have a fresh batch, I read somewhere there\\'s a 500 person limit per referral.  This looks like a promising app. Seriously, if you shop online a lot, checking out in a single place is extremely convenient. \\n\\nI\\'m hoping they have some sort of system beyond the honor system to prohibit people from referring themselves with fake email addresses. That would cost a LOT of money if they\\'re in startup.  You don\\'t get a gift card, exactly. You get a $25 credit usable at various online shopping locations. I used Walmart.com, because Amazon glitched and eBay said it wouldn\\'t take the gift card.\\n\\nSign up and wait for an email saying \"Here download this extension\". It\\'s unobtrusive on-screen, but I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s using browser info related to your searches.\\n\\nAnyway, download it. Once it\\'s on, go do a few of the things it wants like add a shipping address and payment info. I was able to use a defunct prepaid card for this, so I know it\\'s not taking my money.\\n\\nAfter that, go to a site that sells stuff. Make sure you click the tiny icon by your search bar to open the one inch sidebar that has the shop.co cart on it. Click to put it in that cart, NOT the site\\'s. \\n\\nAfter you\\'ve chosen something  (watch shipping!) that\\'s gonna add up to $25, click the bottom cart with the number in it (like Amazon\\'s). It\\'ll take you to a review screen. \\n\\nIt\\'s slow, but remember,  we\\'re beta-testing a new thing. It ain\\'t gonna be perfect and noting all this is why they\\'re paying us.\\n\\nReview the order and then place it. If for some reason it\\'s screwed up, you\\'ll get an error message telling you how to resolve it.\\n\\nPlace the order. I can tell you 100% that it cost me nothing and that the payment method listed on my Walmart receipt is that of a gift card.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t a scam. I have two confirmation emails, one from shop.co and the other from Walmart, telling me they\\'re processing my order.\\n\\nA free backpack for one kid, a dress for another, and Jolly Ranchers for the boys.\\n\\nYes, it\\'s worth it, and Yes, it\\'s real. I have managed to get an order made from Walmart.com (for $24.78, DAMN I\\'m good) and there seemed to be no issues. It\\'s in my completed orders area, and I\\'m supposed to get my items in two days.\\n\\nI\\'ll update if anything doesn\\'t work out. For what it\\'s worth, if this was a phone app, I\\'d be on it like flies on poop because it\\'s incredibly convenient. After the bugs are fixed of course.\\n\\nEdit: Got an error message when attempting eBay. They said they don\\'t accept the promo gift card so you\\'d have to pay normally, then be reimbursed. Too bad, I wanted that Kindle. Just got a reply- maintenance for the next half hour.\\n\\nFigured I\\'d let folks know. I got a message staring they were down for maintenance just a few minutes ago.\\n\\nSad face.\\n\\nThey also made me register a payment method. I used one of my old prepaids with like two cents on it. It said they were having issues with Amazon, I\\'m trying to process a Walmart order right now. I *have* no money to add to the credit so that\\'s not going to be an issue. \\n\\nI got an email from them saying welcome, with a link to the app download... is that my cue to go do my \"job\"? I do almost everything online using my phone, because it\\'s essentially a pocket computer and it\\'s convenient.\\n\\nThis is slightly off-topic though and i don\\'t want modgod to smite me, so I\\'ll just wait for my email.\\n\\nThanks for this opportunity. My daughter wants a new backpack that was cheap on Amazon... Thank you. I\\'ve registered using the referrer name Truman as stated in another post and I verified my email.\\n\\nI\\'ll even fire up the laptop to complete it since apparently my phone isn\\'t good enough.\\n\\nPoor phone. *pets her Samsung* I do PrizeRebel fairly often, I\\'m up to Platinum level which gives me a discount on my rewards plus free points periodically. \\n\\nAll surveys run the risk of \"one wrong answer and KICK twenty minutes wasted\" but they have a pretty wide variety and offer Google Play cards. Would love to do this, refer me please! Think of me showing up to the wedding in cutoffs and a rude T-Shirt.\\n\\nThink of me telling them to fuck straight off when I DON\\'T have a penny in my account!\\n\\nThough, that could cause a heart attack, thereby getting this son his inheritance faster...\\n\\n*takes notes* I live in a small town with a small chain grocery store. The prices are rather higher than Walmart. At Wallyworld I definitely could feed two people for $3. I did, if it\\'s the one I just have a huge thank you to. I\\'m not upset in the least; I\\'ve done surveys enough to know how it goes. Signed up for a few, these links are amazing. Thank you, OP.  Two of those offered no payment at all.\\n\\nI mean, adaptive websites for deaf students is a noble cause, But I don\\'t like doing surveys for free. Hope you get that referral bonus, I did the survey. If this is the same gentleman from the other thread then it was certainly legit for me.\\n\\nDid the call and was paid $10 almost instantly. I\\'d do this repeatedly if he offers more calls.\\n\\nFrom my experience, 100% legit. Further confirming that Oklahoma is filled with stuff that should be posted here. But rises again, stronger. Yes, you can get sponsorships. Good luck with that when you live in the back asshole of nowhere and your family\\'s church decries the idea of pageantry in general. Nobody has money for all that.\\n\\nI found an absolutely gorgeous gown at a thrift store for her for $20, though, appropriate and made in a size 14. This was before she decided she didn\\'t want to do it. \\n\\nIf she had had her heart set on it, I\\'d have moved heaven and earth to get her into it. Honey Boo Boo\\'s family also paraded their dysfunctional hellhole of an existence on national television, so I\\'m sure there\\'s a story behind how she got started on it too. I wouldn\\'t be shocked to hear she was sponsored by the neighborhood meth lab. Completed and paid. Would do again 10/10 My son has Aspergers and is entering the seventh grade. They\\'re teaching him to use a tablet because of his motor skills (horrible handwriting and he really can\\'t help it) as well as offering the use of a resource room when he feels a meltdown coming on (he can be sent involuntarily also).\\n\\nSchools will work with the student to a very large degree as outlined in the kid\\'s IEP.  I didn\\'t draw, have never drawn, did not get the 10myth. \\n\\nSo thirty is not gonna happen. My oldest daughter got an invite to attend this pageant for 10-12yo girls.. we went to the meeting beforehand to check it out.\\n\\nFees upwards of $500, and that\\'s before the \"optional categories\" that still had an effect on your final score. \\n\\nPageants aren\\'t for poor beautiful girls. What about 30+yo who willingly take their 11yo to catch Pokemon? \\n\\n#PokeMom Apple juice concentrate may as well be high fructose corn syrup. It has zero nutritional value and is just sugar under a different name. Questions like this are part of the reason you\\'re desperate for a girlfriend, I suspect. I\\'ll answer you, though, because I believe that information is only a good thing.\\n\\nWomen masturbate for the same reasons that men do, regardless of relationship status. Some women don\\'t like being penetrated by an actual male. Some women are lesbians but still enjoy the feeling of being penetrated, but their partners must turn to artificial penises if their partner desires more. \\n\\nWhy even post this, though? It\\'s not only irrelevant, it\\'s offensive and ignorant....and you had to know that. I\\'m pretty sure I just fell in love with you for a second there.\\n\\n Forever and a day, she was still working there when I quit. Thinking of Rosie O\\'Donnell naked would do it.\\nOf course, after that, I think he might have the opposite problem. I had it happen one day before Christmas while working in the drive thru of America\\'s most popular taco fast food place.\\n\\nThe area plus the restaurant was cruddy enough that it honestly surprised me... but it pleased me, too, because it\\'s unusual.  $bid Texted Probably, but they\\'d put a hold on the funds for a ridiculous amount of time. And the sun....will set for you...\\n\\nGoddamn it. Your sun has set.\\n\\nI\\'m legit teary-eyed over this. I take tramadol for sciatica and fibromyalgia, combined with gabapentin. It works really well as a combination. I\\'ve been on stronger meds and honestly I get more relief from the tram/gaba combination than I did on hydrocodone or ms contin. $confirm /u/ImNotFish 100 $confirm /u/ImnotFish $100 $confirm  $100 Tramadol really isn\\'t a strong pain med.\\n\\nThat said, in my experience, doctors either swear by it or think it\\'s Satan in pill form. \\n\\nGoing in asking for drugs sounds like bad form, and it can be.... but it can also be perfectly okay if you do it correctly. Doctors aren\\'t stupid. They tend to have decent bullshit detectors. If codeine is OTC in your location, saying that you\\'ve \"been taking OTCs and they\\'re becoming less effective\" is 100% okay to say.\\n\\n\"Relying heavily on codeine\"? Not so much. They\\'ll understand what you mean regardless. Don\\'t offer too much information. \\n\\nResearch your condition and go in armed. If a certain medication is widely known to help with your pain, point your provider in that direction! Some doctors like it when patients are proactive in their care... others hate it, and you want one of the former.\\n\\nShow a pain diary. How you feel on waking, midday, at rest... documentation separates you from someone who might be chasing a high from someone chasing relief.\\n\\nMost providers these days won\\'t prescribe on the first visit, and be willing to comply with pillcounts, UAs, and all that.\\n\\nI hope you get the relief you need.\\n Not only stuck in the water temple but I\\'m pretty sure I forgot to get the hookshot and OH GOD IT\\'S THE JELLYTHI-\\n\\n*glub* It\\'s really not anyone\\'s place to say how much pain you experience but you. They don\\'t get to tell you that. It\\'s your body.\\n\\nI\\'ve been told that I \"shouldn\\'t be in that much pain\" too. I switched providers and sure enough, more tests were run and they discovered a ruptured ovarian cyst and endometriosis. You\\'re in Canada, right? Can you switch PCPs?\\n\\nI really sympathise with you as I have been in your position. Hang in there.  That one reminds me of a nutsack, I\\'m sorry. .... 2020?\\n\\nYou have to wait *two and a half years* to be seen for pain management? \\n\\nYou might want to look into going to a different provider. That\\'s obscene. At this point, I would be demanding to be appropriately treated for my conditions. Whether that\\'s medication or PT or whatever, I\\'d be getting it, probably from whoever referred me to a place with a two year wait. \\n\\nThey can\\'t do that to you. That\\'s ridiculous.  Reddit while half asleep = Not noting which sub you\\'re in Line jumping. You learn not to cut in line in kindergarten, why do you suddenly think it\\'s okay now that you\\'re forty? \\n\\nPeople look shocked when you inform them that the end of the line is back there. I\\'ve done this more than once, because I don\\'t care if they don\\'t like it. Rudeness for no reason makes me with I could shoot people. I\\'ve handed rude teenagers a broom and dustpan when I was working lobby at Taco Bell. \\n\\nIf my kids make a mess, I make them clean it up. There\\'s no excuse for trashing a restaurant.  I\\'m not a pharmacist, I\\'m a patient.\\n\\nThe *entire staff* at my independent pharmacy is completely awesome. They know me by name. They check on my refills if I have another related prescription come in. They expedited a PA for my meds once, without me even asking.\\n\\nI love them, love them, love them and if I could name them here I would.\\n\\nPharmDs and techs have an important job. I\\'ve informed other people that the reason their stuff takes 20-30min might not be THEIR meds, but the twelve others on the Escript or fax. That it\\'s more than \"shove pills in bottle and label it\". \\n\\nI thank the staff at my independent every month and they\\'re always giving me 100% service.\\n\\nThank all of you who care about your patients.  I used to work at Waffle House before they automated the registers. All servers were REQUIRED to make change, and calculator use was discouraged. \\n\\nPeople would come in and fill out applications and ask me to do their math tests. This was simple arithmetic. \\n\\nMy kids can do this in their heads  (I taught them my little mental tricks for easy math). No adult should fail at this simple task, barring dyscalculia (sp?), yet I run into the issue at least once a week. The look on peoples\\' faces when their computer fails to tell them the answer is priceless, a complete deer-in-the-headlights moment... and thankfully, they usually listen to me when I give the answer.  Have a t-shirt with just this on it, with Bender in shiny gold.\\n\\nLove it. I stabbed a man who tried to rape me with his own knife.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I was terrified and he was drink, but fuck him, I just recall seeing the weapon, bashing his wrist on my knee, stabbing him in the leg, then running like hell for a phone to call 911. I usually run raids with my FB group, thank god, Where we plan this shit out beforehand. \\n\\nIn Randomland, playing Ysh or Tyro is an adventure in \"what is the other idiot gonna do?\"\\n\\nPlus,  don\\'t overwrite my full breakdowns, people. Did it with two III characters (OK and Luneth), Cloud (with USB/BSB2), Vaan (almost completely legend dived with BSB) and Ysh.\\n\\nRW\\'d Zack Chain. Was a bitch. I run Vaan with a gun 90% of the time. It sucks because his legend abilities emphasize the dagger, but realistically I deal more overall with another melee in the front. Give him/her credit for tenacity.\\n\\n99s aren\\'t required for even Apoc level. This is why, when I run Ysh with randoms, I will delay my action until I see what the hell they\\'re doing. Terpsichore\\'s attack name can only be Pyrrhic Kleos and you know it. Plus, fights from each city path should be a thing.\\n\\nCait Sith should be a thing. A summon, something, she needs to exist in FFRK. She\\'s a holy summon in FFXI, attacks of Regal Gash  (damage), Mewing Lullaby (AoE Sleep and 100% 0TP), and Eerie Eye (AoE and amnesia, something else too). Astral Flow ability.. don\\'t recall the name but it\\'s an AoE Arise. \\n\\n Where I live (Oklahoma) you can hit the reservations and get a carton of (sorta shitty) cigs for  $21.\\n\\nDamn. Sure, they might be having a bad day.\\n\\nThey can choose to not act like total douches in public, though... Or if they do, apologize like an adult. Everyone has slipped up and said something they shouldn\\'t. Getting fired over saying \"Bite me\" to an overgrown man child should never happen. I accidentally hit the mythril button instead of the gem button and got 4* junk. I rubbed my eyes and did my 100gem. \\n\\nPhantom.\\n\\nNot complaining.  I generally run Shout + Ysh as Wall, Curaja/Wrath, RW Keepers and win that way. \\n\\nRarely do i ever need to use my Medica2, but fanned if it hasn\\'t saved me at least twice.  I started my addiction during the Cloud BSB event, pulling Tifa SSB and then failing to use it because I hate Tifa. After finding this place, I realized the error of my ways and she was in my A Team for a long time. \\n\\nMy husband and my 10yo twins all play FFRK as well, with differing enthusiasm. I\\'m often found in the KBP chat, doing MP, and declaring myself to be \"FFRK\\'S mom\".\\n\\nI have 175 stamina, and 2 mythril because I have the self control of a toddler when it comes to pulling. I have Quadrinity (Wall/Medica/Hastega/Shout) and an OP A-Team for physical parties.\\n\\nMy husbando is Pecil and waifu is Lightning; I\\'m allowed both!  Do you still want cards and stuff? I have 2 daughters ages 10 and 6 who love to draw, and would gladly draw cards for your little girl.\\n\\nThis made me cry. I can give you a referral code to Blink Health that will give you $15 off your first order. Blink is even cheaper than GoodRX and better for pharmacies\\' bottom lines as well, because they don\\'t force them to accept negative dispensing fees. Blink has you pay online before you go to the pharmacy, and they text/email you a Blink Card you show the pharmacist. You pay no copays at the pharmacy itself; only online. \\n\\nAlmost all pharmacies accept it; I\\'m 99% sure yours does as well.\\n\\nLet me know if you want the referral code! :) When I worked at an Awful Waffle, we had this old dude who\\'d constantly call me \"baby\".\\n\\nI freaking LOATHE being called baby, honey, etc. The morning was busy enough that it was stressful, and he called out over the din, \"Baby, can you get me some French toast? (Not on menu, but I made it for some)\" \\n\\nSpatula in hand,  I whirled around and yelled, \"I\\'d rather choke to death on a live weasel than be your ANYTHING!\" \\n\\nThe guy turned beet red, the whole restaurant laighed, and he apologized to me afterward.  This asshole.\\n\\nOutside of all video game logic, you can silence him. \\n\\nMakes him a piece of cake, but fuck did i get sick of this guy. My in-laws are this. They jokingly call me in-house tech support, because I\\'m pretty sure that my father in law did something very similar to this...no, it was my 10yo son. Who should know better.\\n\\nKid: Mom, my phone is broken! *hands me his phine, which is used for games, music, and 911 access only. I press some buttons and plug it in and wait 5 minutes, then power it up. Only thing that\\'s wrong is that the battery is at 2%...*\\n\\nMe: (Son\\'s Name) so tell me...when did you charge this last?\\n\\nKid: ooooops mom. The last guy who tried to attack me with a knife got it taken away from him and returned buried in his leg.\\n\\nIn my defense, he tried to sexually assault me and thought that the knife would assist him. All it did was make him really visible to the cops I called after I stabbed him and ran.\\n\\nIf a terrified young woman can disarm a would-be attacker and use their weapon against them, what do you think an intruder would be capable of?\\n\\nKnives are for show unless trained. My husband and I worked at a popular yellow sign restaurant where the servers tell the cooks their orders in special restaurant code. One busy as hell Saturday morning, the steam table between the two mini grills destabilized and collapsed, sending two containers of hot grits all over his lower body, not to mention the metal parts. We called 911 because he was fairly burned...and those inconsiderate people we called customers insisted that I cook for them, in the open kitchen, dancing around slippery grits AND emergency services.\\n\\nMy first instincts were to tell them to go &5!# themselves, but no, I made their damned omelets....\\n\\nCustomers can be awesome, yes, but other times they\\'re a pimple on the giant ass that is life.  Hulk Smash. \\n\\nIn seriousness, though...ardor sounds pretty fair. BLU is indeed rather good but it\\'s not something you can slap sparks gear on and play effectively. You have to go out and farm spells as well. \\n\\nDepending on what you\\'re trying to do should determine job/subjob, and these days, assuming you\\'ve done limit breaks and junk, it takes approximately two or so hours with a friendly cleave partner to go from 1-99.\\n\\nThat said, I read you were having Cloud of Darkness issues. Are you on Bahamut? If so, I\\'m fairly certain I could help you knock it out. The fight has weird mechanics. I have a full FFRK family :\\n\\nSpouse and my twins (boy and girl). \\n\\n..and I\\'m still the only one without a BSB.  Cagnazzo. Seriously, fuck that crab. I though almost everything about it was incomprehensibly stupid. \\n\\nBahamut from the 3 event. Yay, no 3 synergy except a pile of 4* core SB junk and the nothing I pulled on the banners! I had to level Agrias even without a relic for her because I needed a tanky spellblade. \\n\\nRufus and his goddamn dog. Mako Cannon, Mako Cannon, Mako Cannon. \\'Nuff said.\\n\\nAnd finally, the sonofabitch who I fought for two days past event close and STILL didn\\'t beat, Caius Fucking Ballad. The irony is that I love his character a lot, but this fight? FUCK that! NOTHING I did could edge me past that last 5% I regularly got him to before horrible death. He broke my streak of full event mastery and for that, he can ESAD. 100 gem: Seph\\'s Coat. I can\\'t complain.  I hope that they don\\'t send you a C&D for using their art without permission. That would suck, because they certainly wouldn\\'t put out something so cute and apparently in demand.  I didn\\'t do a true 11 pull but I did two Co3 and 6 or 7 singles. \\n\\nOffbanner junk x2 reported. I got Aerith\\'s Wizard Rod thingie with Pulse of Life on it a few months ago. \\n\\nI almost fell out of my chair. When who is proved wrong, by chance? \"I\\'d call you a douche, but that would imply that you could get near a vagina.\" Yeah, I just eyeballed the time for it... 7pm PST. \\n\\nThat\\'s a really odd time. Off-banner ffx braver with no SB. \\n\\nThis is the 3rd time this has happened; I am less than amused. Body fluid = yuck.\\n\\nSociety\\'s fixation on sex, getting sex, emphasis on sex, etc just plain pisses me off sometimes. I don\\'t get how people can be so obsessed with mucus membranes rubbing together all the time.\\n\\nI mean, I\\'ve had sex; I have children. That\\'s the PURPOSE of sex, procreation. It\\'s not fun, recreational, or even something to be sought.\\n\\nI also am grossed out by the idea that every man who looks at me is imagining me naked. I think it was on /r/creepy, cause I posted on that with a link to /r/nope Oh.\\n\\nHELL.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nGot a blowtorch?  Ehh, smaller country places that are essentially one big room can do okay if they\\'re not slammed.\\n\\nMostly, though, as a former cook/server/dish, I completely 1000% agree with you. Chaos is bad. Sometimes, I deliberately make themed parties to increase difficulty  (or just because I can), but I\\'d never imply that others must do the same or they\\'re playing easymode.\\n\\nIf you (OP) wish to gimp yourself, feel free. Don\\'t expect me to agree with it, though.  Do not want r34 valefor, ever , no. Was screwing with my husband\\'s account, which has SG and SLG. \\n\\nIt is absolutely 100% possible to keep both as options, Dark Bargain/ Lifesiphon + Dr. Mog for initial SG. With Thor Hammer it was hitting neutral targets (no weakness, no resists) for 9999x4. Attack boost was War Dance.\\n\\nYes, SLG is worth it. /r/nope Everyone gets the origin of mine completely wrong. Blitz Sword from VIII, and Celebration Grimoire. \\n\\nFirst non-Tyro weapon was Quistis\\' Red Scorpion.  Mine\\'s 26. \\n\\n/sads The one for the original Lethal Weapon movie aired on network TV...\\n\\n\"This is a real badge, I\\'m a real cop, and this is a real firing gun.\"\\n\\n I need some brain bleach, stat.  \"Come down here and play with us nyeeeeow!\" I read my first King book at age eight- Firestarter. Since then, I\\'ve read almost everything else that he\\'s written.\\n\\nIt was good, but The Stand is my all time favorite. I am partial to The Talisman, though.... but Black House just wasn\\'t as good.\\n\\nI refuse to comment on the ending of the Dark Tower series on the grounds that it will piss people off. It\\'s almost impossible to prove a case for wrongful termination or discrimination unless it was blatant. In most states, you can be fired for pretty much anything that isn\\'t a protected status. A smart (and unscrupulous ) employer would claim one of those reasons instead of agreeing with you.\\n\\nYou might be eligible for unemployment; it depends on whether or not your termination was due to willful misconduct. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry this happened to you, for what it\\'s worth.  You should probably ask your treating physician about this, because I\\'m sure the last thing you want to do is to cause yourself further pain.\\n\\nThat said, I know from personal experience that water-based exercises are a lot more doable than the regular sort. As with anything, start off small and work your way up.\\n\\nHave a low-pain day ^^ TIL that being a massive douche is a talent.  Arciela please.\\n\\nHer abilities would be all over the place, though, because she was sort of a RDM...\\n\\nSSB Nakuaal\\'s Vengeance yesplease.\\n\\nThere are so many characters and antagonists available from XI, if they ignore that in favor of rehashed VII content then I think they\\'re being stupid. I didn\\'t notice for either one and I only have 2 XII weapons.\\n\\nI did it with five knights, though, for giggles, so I had good stats I guess. I know exactly how you feel.\\n\\nWhen I was 16, I had my first child. It was a somewhat difficult birth, probably because I was too young to be having a baby, but we managed to get through it. He cried CONSTANTLY. As he grew older, it became obvious he wasn\\'t like other babies. He didn\\'t talk, he\\'d flap his hands in front of his eyes, he\\'d bang his head on the walls in this awful rhythm...\\n\\nHis father wasn\\'t home much and didn\\'t help at all. My own family... I was estranged from them.\\n\\nI loved my son, he was my kid. I even loved him when he\\'d have a massive meltdown in public and I\\'d have to physically restrain him so he wouldn\\'t hurt himself or someone else. \\n\\nWhen he\\'d scream for hours on end. \\n\\nWhen I felt like I was at the end of my rope.\\n\\nIt\\'s not your fault that you\\'re overwhelmed. It\\'s not shameful, it\\'s not bad. You\\'re raising a developmentally delayed child when you\\'re hardly more than a child yourself.\\n\\nThe anger, the disappointment... It\\'s all normal. There\\'s nothing wrong with how you feel.\\n\\nI think you should let your son stay with her for a little while. Maybe not permanently, but long enough for you to set up a support system for BOTH of you. The school system absolutely is required to help you. Push for an IEP. Once he\\'s in school with people who are trained to help regulate his behaviors, it will improve.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t feel bad for enjoying the hours you spend apart from him. It doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t love him. It only means you\\'re human. The grocery store in the tiny town nearest to me has Wed-Wed sales. I think the other stores in this local chain do as well. Tyger is the one on the left. Tinnin is the one on the right. They sleep like this all the time. Sooo...this lady would rather have someone potentially spread disease and risk unplanned pregnancy than be safer about it? \\n\\nTeenagers are going to have sex, so putting barriers to practice safer sex is counterproductive. \\n\\nDumbass woman. I miss XI sometimes, myself. I had gotten into endgame junk, broken down and made pld relic shield, had Tartarus Platemail and even a Zendik off WoC for my fastcast... but drama ensued as it tends to on an mmo. \\n\\nThat part I don\\'t miss at all, lol.\\n\\nIf anyone here is from Bahamut, my character name was/is the same as it is here. Hi. ^^ I didn\\'t play at the very beginning, but I did play for almost 3 years until a few months ago.\\n\\nThere\\'s a crab for every level...\\n\\nAnd no matter how powerful you are, somewhere in Vana\\'diel there\\'s a bunny that will kick your ass.\\n\\nAlso: SMN BLU RUN PLD power!! Because U+ Kam\\'lanaut would be sooooo much fun. :(\\n\\nActually, it might be. Can\\'t cheese Light Blade on FFRK though. Working for ANY chain is gonna suck. Menus changing, different suggestive sells, corporate bullshit, high turnover, corporate bullshit, shifting schedules, and did I mention there might just be a fair amount of corporate bullshit? \\n\\nIf you can manage it, I\\'d wait until i found a good, privately owned restaurant to work at. If you absolutely have to, work at a chain only long enough to get you to your better job. If it\\'s a private individual, you can check public records such as property taxes, voter registration, or similar public information.  As a mom, I am aware: 3 year old kids whack their heads with alarming regularity. \\n\\nOlder friends and/or siblings can be responsible for the head-whacking sometimes, too.\\n\\nDealing with CPS is absolutely not fun, especially if you\\'re under investigation  (you probably are) for abuse or neglect. Your mistake was ignoring the symptoms of a serious head injury, not necessarily the fact that you didn\\'t tell your ex-wife. I probably wouldn\\'t remember my kid whacking their head unless and until they started telling about a headache or barfing. \\n\\nThe process of a CPS investigation will likely be close to this :\\n\\nThey\\'ll want to speak to you asap. Whether or not you wish to have an attorney present is up to you and up to your state\\'s laws. If they recommend criminal neglect charges to the DA, you don\\'t want to tell them anything they could use to make you look bad.\\n\\nCPS is not there to help you. They are (supposedly) there to help children in need. Keep that in mind.\\n\\nSince he\\'s hospitalized, and your ex-wife has primary (?) custody, they probably won\\'t be going for a temporary removal order. They may go to family court for a temporary modification of visitation until the investigation is over...requiring supervised visits and the like.\\n\\nDepending on the initial findings, they\\'ll either call the neglect case unfounded or they\\'ll bring you into family court to answer for the offense. Criminal charges may or may not be filed. They\\'ll probably recommend parenting classes, which you will want to complete. \\n\\nGood luck and i.hope your son gets better fast.\\n\\nInfo Source: don\\'t ask... If it states \"One per customer\" and not \"One per visit\", I would have denied the second coupon (mainly because she\\'d been rude). One word: \\n\\n#lol\\n\\nIn all seriousness, the most likely reason you can\\'t buy firearms is because of a felony conviction someplace. Simply being accused of a crime definitely isn\\'t a bar- innocent until proven guilty, remember? \\n\\nNext time, if you want answers to a made up scenario, don\\'t post it from the same account you post your narcotics reviews from.  I have a 13/20 5* Platinum Sword(FFT) because it\\'s my best sword and I love it.\\n\\nNo regrets at all. The only thing that beats it is a native 5* synergy weapon; without synergy or if it\\'s a 4++, the plat sword is better. ....what did i just read? BDSM for Jesus? With the latter example, an opposing attorney could argue that they were making assumptions about your ex that they were unqualified to make.\\n\\nA good lawyer can sniff out a liar, trip them up on inconsistencies, and expose them in front of the judge. You don\\'t need a human lie detector; few people are good enough liars to keep up an elaborate story in a high pressure situation like court. It\\'s possible to use medical records, provided they were from before you turned five, to support a delayed birth record application. \\n\\nThough from what you\\'re saying it\\'s unlikely you went to a doctor unless it was an emergency. \\n\\nYou may have to wait until you turn 18 to pursue this fully, and you probably will need the assistance of someone familiar with such things. Your local Legal Aid could point you in the right direction.  The answer to \"Can they sue?\" is always yes.\\n\\nWhether or not they\\'d get laughed out of court is an entirely different matter. /facepalm\\n\\nI hope you were speaking in the hypothetical and not actually self-incriminating.  They honestly don\\'t care.\\n\\nWhile in custody of the Department of Corrections, one has very few choices they can make. Health care is not one of them. Medical care while in custody is theoretically guaranteed, but it isn\\'t timely or quality. God help you if you\\'re on a controlled substance or a medication not on the jail/prison formulary.\\n\\nNote: This may have changed since I was in the system. \\n If they hired you, there is no way in this world or the next that they\\'ve ever had evidence or suspected you of taking ANYTHING from their business.\\n\\nNo lectures here either; I assume you\\'re a mature adult who knows what they want to do.\\n\\nThat said, confessing now could (remote possibility) result in criminal charges and would almost definitely result in getting fired.  Unless your state didn\\'t expand Medicaid, and you make TOO LITTLE to qualify for subsidy! \\n\\nThis is a thing, it happened to me. Medicaid covers my children, but my spouse and I can go fuck ourselves because his job deliberately keeps its employees from being able to qualify for benefits, and I\\'m disabled and unable to work outside the home.\\n\\nLovely, isn\\'t it. I\\'m not 100% sure of Texas law, as a disclaimer. Also, not a lawyer, nor do I play one on TV. \\n\\nI would think that a property management company or owner of an apartment complex would be likely to have workers on staff to fix issues, opposed to a single property owner who may have to hire a contractor. \\n\\nPersonally, if I had a large enough discount, I\\'d probably do it. I\\'m not afraid to take a negligent landlord to court if they try to screw me. Knowing your rights can make you more comfortable with the risks involved. Legally responsible, yes.\\n\\nWilling to do so? Maybe not.\\n\\nWhen you need a repair and they won\\'t do it, paying into escrow covers YOUR ass, because you\\'re still paying your monthly rent. The landlord just won\\'t get it until repairs are made. \\n\\nPre paying will disallow escrow, and with an unscrupulous landlord could allow them to figuratively flip you the finger of you need something done.\\n\\nIf they don\\'t make the repairs, you can sue them. You may or may not win. They COULD, yes, but usually in the case of a chronic condition like diabetes or HBP, they set your appointments, and dr/nurse initiated appointments aren\\'t subject to the jail copay.\\n\\nAlso, the only time you can use your own insurance  (that I recall) was if you needed medical treatment outside the facility. Also note that you won\\'t be denied a basic hygiene pack or medical services if you never get anything deposited. Most jails also give a few stamps per week to indigent inmates.\\n\\nThe indigent pack is EXTREMELY basic, though- I remember Bob Barker brand shampoo (that didn\\'t lather), hotel-like soap (that made your skin drier than the Mojave), clear \"deodorant\" (calling it that is being extremely generous, it smelled funny), a tiny toothpaste  (that a lot of inmates use as improvised glue), and a toothbrush. Oh, and a black pocket comb.\\n\\nYou\\'re very kind to give money to make your relative\\'s jail term more bearable.\\n\\nNote: I know jail isn\\'t supposed to be pleasant. I\\'m just providing an inside look of sorts. Generally speaking, inmates are charged for each medical visit and for any medications prescribed. You\\'ll also be charged for undergarments, the basic hygiene pack, and stamped envelopes.\\n\\nThese charges are levied against you even if you are indigent. Should anyone deposit money into your account, they\\'ll take what they\\'re owed immediately, before informing the inmate that they\\'d been credited. \\n\\nUsually, the inmate would receive a statement, showing the deposit amount and any funds deducted.\\n\\nSome jurisdictions will take jail fees or court ordered costs from inmate accounts as well.\\n\\nSource: I did a lot of stupid shit when I was younger and have personal experience.

Oh dear, his Hand wilted (among other things).\\n\\nThat was awesome. ^.^ Would they help someone with fairly severe agoraphobia and social anxiety?\\n\\nI have a hard time dealing with people face to face, especially outside of my safety zone. \\n\\nI apologize for what may be dumb questions.  Generally speaking, and I\\'ve been in this situation, agencies such as DHS and SSA will accept a signed/notarized statement from the person providing shelter as proof of no income.\\n\\nI\\'ve had to do this in the past, and they never questioned me. Be sure to include contact info on the statement; they\\'ll call to verify it. It all started with the ad in the Nickel. \\n\\n\"Earn Great Money, Clinical Trials Near You!\"\\n\\nBring broker than hell had left me with few options in life. I\\'d already been to the food bank this week, and DHS was taking its sweet-ass time in approving me for benefits. Losing your job was never good; losing it when you lived in BFE and had a record was even worse.\\n\\nI shrugged internally and entered the address on my smartphone, grateful that I had three more weeks remaining on my prepaid plan. A blander version of the Nickel ad appreared on my tiny screen, listing a phone number and a short list of requirements for study inclusion. \\n\\n-Age between 25-40. Well, that fit me easily. \\n\\n-Reasonably healthy. I wasn\\'t fat, my spinal issue wasn\\'t from illness, and I figured I\\'d squeak past.\\n\\n-Mental health evaluation to be performed onsite.\\n\\nI eyed that little gem, stifling a word that rhymed with \\'truck\\' several times under my breath. \\n\\nThen I committed the number to memory. What\\'s the worst that could happen? They\\'d tell me no, and on the site they promised  nominal compensation just got evaluation. Wondering just what they were testing, I dialed the number with a half-smile.\\n\\n  --\\'--------\\'-------\\'-------\"\\n\\n\"This way, Ms. Kelly.\" A woman in a thigh-length white coat escorted me to a brightly lit room that held a chair that reminded me very strongly of a dentist\\'s chair. I\\'d somehow made it to the end of their eval process, God only knew how, and I still didn\\'t know exactly what they had in mind.\\n\\nFifty thousand dollars, though... As long as it didn\\'t *kill* me, I couldn\\'t afford to say no.\\n\\n\"Please, have a seat. My name is Dr. Stratton.\" She leafed through a file on the counter. \"I believe you prefer to be called Shan?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah.\" I said, sitting on the edge of the chair while scanning the room. The headrest of the chair had a thick cable that led to a tall cabinet of some sort several feet away from me. \\n\\n\"Shan, as you know, we are conducting an experimental procedure. Before you undergo the procedure, there\\'s paperwork that needs to be done. Releases, a nondisclosure agreement, and I will explain what the risks are once you sign-\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t really have a choice, and I was always a fast reader. I grabbed the sheaf of papers, plucked the pen she was waving around out of her hand, and proceeded to scribble my name approximately seventeen hundred times.\\n\\nWords like \"matter replication\", \"induced dissociation\", \"personality division\", and \"enhancement\" jumped out at me, but I didn\\'t believe it. It was science fiction.\\n\\nHanding the papers back, I made myself scoot back in the chair. \"I\\'m your guinea pig, Doc.\"\\n\\n\"This could have unintended consequences, Ms. Kelly-\"\\n\\nI interrupted. \"Look. I\\'m broke, I have no job, and no prospects of same. I sort of have to do this.\"\\n\\nShe bit her lip and nodded, taking the forms with her. It was then that I noticed that there were no other candidates anywhere that I had seen.\\n\\nI closed my eyes and waited. I had no choice.\\n\\n--------------------\\n\\n\"Shan. Shan, wake up!\" I knew that voice from somewhere. My head throbbed like a rotten tooth. My eyes didn\\'t want to open, and when I shook my head I felt as though I was going to throw up my toenails.\\n\\n\"Ugh, keep your pants on!\" I mumbled. Hey, now I recognized the voice! \\n\\nIt was mine. \\n\\nMy eyes flew open, and before me was a woman who could have been my identical twin. My mouth opened, and no sound came out. I thought furiously: *Who the fuck are YOU?*\\n\\nAn answer came, shockingly enough. *I\\'m you. Except I\\'m not you. They want to kill us, Shan, let\\'s GO!\"\\n\\nAs my eyes widened, my doppelganger nodded firmly. She featured toward the cabinet, where the broken body of Dr. Stratton was sprawled out almost obscenely. \\n\\n\"Okay. No. I\\'m still drugged.\" I said.\\n\\nMy twin slapped me across the face. \"No. You\\'re not. That bitch was going to kill us. I saved us, and I\\'m gonna KEEP saving us. I\\'m Rena, and I\\'m you, and we are.. we are one into two.\" She tugged at my hand and I stood up, the implications hitting me like a freight train.\\n\\nNot many knew this about me, but I was schizophrenic, paranoid type. \\n\\nI let Rena drag me away from this place and into our new lives.\\n\\n------\\'-\\n\\nConstructive criticism welcome :D Welcome to the \"Turtle Slayer\\'s Club\"!\\n Well damn, I shattered my Raise, guess I should fix that issue.

The killer is the female jail doctor.

Unsolved Mysteries - Share your Favorites\\n\\nUser8675309\\n\\nWas a few years ago, and I may be lying about the unsolved bit- they may have locked up the guys responsible, \\'specially cause they were all in jail to begin with. \\n\\nSeemed like a plague of suicides hit the Hi-Power unit, that\\'s the one where they keep the REAL scumbags like diaper snipers and killers and dope dealin freaks.\\n\\nWas kinda weird though, the way it happened. See, they were in lockdown except when showering, an they did that in pairs, that and sick call.\\n\\nThey all died during sick call, and man, was it sick! Them boys were waiting to pull their chains to the Staties, all for junk that\\'d set our ladies here hair on end,  and each time one would end up hanging by his own pants, violated by one of the other dudes taken down to the infirmary holding pen. Course, they swore they was innocent, that they were in seein\\' the  nurse when the other guy bit it, but DNA don\\'t lie, and there was a ton of it if you get my drift.\\n\\nStill seemed kinda weird to me..That lady doc didn\\'t know a thing either, no noise, no nothing!\\n\\nRedditCalling\\n\\nYou\\'re a fool, first off.\\n\\nYes. Men were convicted of these murders. As you stated, DNA doesn\\'t lie. \\n\\nThey were a scar upon the face of humanity and deserved to be lasered away. \\n\\nWhat you DON\\'T know is that no man murdered those men, DNA or no DNA. \\n\\nA girl has to be creative in her work, after all.\\n\\n-\\'------\\n\\nSorry if that sucked, first try I managed to get them pulled because of Medicaid, which gave dental services to pregnant women in my state  (and my area is pretty darn rural). The free clinics for dental services are not only an hour away but limited to county residents only. If it were only the distance I\\'d have found a way. The school is the same way. I was denied for CareCredit because my income was too low, and my state opted out of expanded Medicaid, and I make too little to qualify for a subsidy on the Exchange.\\n\\nI bless the fact that I have no teeth, it means my mouth doesn\\'t hurt anymore.

Plus, running out of hones was a thing.\\n Fffffff\\n\\nThis\\n\\nJerkwad. \\n\\nGeryon was pathetic, died really fast (and dropped a Major Lightning) but Cag can honestly kiss my skinny pale white ass. \\n\\nNo offense intended to those who aren\\'t skinny, white, pale, or don\\'t have asses. \\n\\n I grew up not far from here. In fact, I went to summer camp at Crater Lake (Jesus Christ that Water is freezing).\\n\\nNow live in the fugliest state in the union. What the FUCK. /wrists I surely hope so, as I have both Eiko\\'s and Aerith\\'s. I got three today in three 90-stam runs. 2x Wind, one Lightning.\\n\\nI was not displeased.  rngU for my Flute-using Ramza, over 250 Mind, more in ff9 because that\\'s where 2/3 of his gear is from.\\n\\nEnjoy~ Did this with BOTH Cecils, because I indeed like Cecil, so I had Cecil and Cecil help me fight Cecil.  Shantotto is a Tarutaru. Also known as just Taru or as \"football\" or  \"Sacrifice\", e.g. you can sacrifice a Taru for increased drops, game legend and autotranslate states. :P\\n\\nAnd she\\'s scary as all hell, talks in rhyme while she broils you alive.\\n\\nI THINK Y\\'shtola\\'s race is called Miqot\\'e or however you spell it, essentially a ripoff of FFXI\\'s Mithra and yep, catgirls. No majors today but I have gotten quite a few gyshal greens.  I might be ok with that. I do appreciate your translation work :) Caius Ballad as a character. A playable one, not just what I think is going to be one of the most irritating Ultimates ever. You get Rosa through the event, so using a soul on her is probably not needed.\\n\\n There\\'s no Derufuku Tower in FFXI, it\\'s probably Delkfutt\\'s, which is pretty important in the storylines.\\n\\nIf i knew the boss name I could probably say for certain. Odin gave me some dialogue at the start of the fight and at the end, is this because I brought Pecil?\\n\\nSo did Dark Knight, that time I had both Cecils in party.  When I finally get another mc2 to break Cloud for Mako Might, I\\'ll probably use that for all the reasons stated. \\n\\nSince I don\\'t, and Ramza stole my Dr. Mog\\'s and won\\'t give it back, I generally use Paladin\\'s Devotion. It grants a chance to heal about 30% of your max HP when struck physically. That has been a blessing in AoE heavy fights.\\n\\nIt\\'s P.Cecil\\'s RM3, though. So should I grab Golbez for that Ebon Armor I pulled way back when I started? 3x 5-mythril pulls, absolute pewp. \\n\\nI was hoping for medica to add to Team White Mage; the girls would love to add ...whichever twin is the girl I mix them up always... Not sure, really. I shared my friend code in the official site as well as with those I played FFXI with, so some of my followers could be from that.\\n\\nI\\'ve decided to keep it as Shout for now, but I can change on request to several options.\\n\\nReraise medicas (Eiko or Aerith, your choice)\\nRegen medica\\nWar Dance (ew)\\nDivine Guardian \\nMighty Guard (VIII)\\nHand of the Emperor\\n\\nPlus assorted dps, just ask me ^.^ Well, I see the point in not using a pure DPS ability.\\n\\nSome other options I have are Hand of the Emperor, MG, DG, about four medicas... I was called a bad mom because my (then) there year old daughter threw one of THOSE tantrums in Wal-Mart, and I turned my back and told her I\\'d look at her again when she decided to stop screaming.\\n\\nDidn\\'t leave the aisle, heck I was five feet away, but this old lady said I was abusing my kid by letting her shriek.\\n I did it with Cloud solo yesterday from 53 to 65, WITHOUT Unyielding Fist.\\n\\nMuch S/L ensued.\\n\\nI used Reta and a r3 Bladeblitz, with Indomitable Blade as my RW.  Vivi with Ruinga r4 and Meteor r1. Clears the garbage and gives him Doublecast Decay for the boss. I got one (Aerith\\'s freaking SSB O.O) last month, so all I have to say is keep hoping!\\n\\nSide Note: haven\\'t pulled shyte since, used up all my luck Hellfire wiped my normal A-Team when I ignored the nail, thinking \"Oh, it won\\'t be that bad.\"\\n\\nHahahaha melted. My loud \"WHAT THE F*CK?!\" prompted my son to tell me to watch my language.  Straight from FFV, I just watched my husband do this.  Considering it\\'s Shantotto, my bet is on Windurst, since that\\'s where she\\'s from.\\n\\nCould use some of the better gear from XI here, lol, like perhaps mythic BLM staff for Lady Karababa here.\\n\\n(An alias for Shantotto.)\\n\\nWhy in the nine hells does she have Monk, she\\'s a freaking mage, Darkness would have been more in flavor as could White Mage.  Finally mastered U+, thanks for all the help, encouragement, and tips, guys!\\n\\nCan\\'t seem to copypasta the template on mobile, but my team ended up being:\\n\\nRW Sentinel\\'s Grimoire\\n\\nTifa, 80, Lifesiphon 6, Lifesiphon 6, Dolphin Blow \\n\\nGreg, 77, Lifesiphon 6, Banishing Strike 6, BroFist \\n\\nYuna, 68, Protectga 4.

The regen made healing doable, and I was able to delay my first use of Wall until after Gravija, which by definition can\\'t kill you.\\n\\nPop SG and Shout, unleashing the 2 SSB I had ready, keeping HP high and renewing Breakdowns, MG, and Protect as needed.\\n\\nPost Meteor, pop medica and race damage.\\n\\nLost 3 medals, 2 damage, one action. \\n\\nI don\\'t care, mastery obtained, eff you, Ultima. If you don\\'t want it permanently on your phone, in theory you could download just long enough to get the initial 80-some points, then delete it. \\n\\nFree stuff benefits everyone, and the chances of anything untoward happening to your phone in the ten minutes it\\'ll be installed are around those of being struck by lightning. \\n\\nTwice.\\n\\nWhile pulling 11 5* on an 11-pull. I\\'m gonna go try that right now. \\n\\nYeah, I never got anything good for Cloud so I\\'ve let him languish at level 50, knowing that Mako Might is something that I really could use. I have Ace Striker and Battleforged, so there\\'s that. I plan on slapping those into my best DDs  (Cecil and Greg).\\n\\nThank you very much! I installed, read everything, set it for notifications, and log in daily, so I hope it helps. Excellent advice, two snags- I am gonna HAVE to burn Cloud up to 65 and pray Mako Might drops...plus my FB is only r1 and there is no possible way of me getting the orbs to rank it up. Everything else I can definitely do, and I\\'m guessing RW a Wall. Thank you for the info and fast response! :D Is this going to be released tonight? U+ is seriously pissing me off. \\n\\nAfter being screwed by the RNG multiple times in a row,  after switching up my team, after nearly throwing my phone in frustration.... I CLEARED it on the first night, but mastery is eluding me.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried almost every character I have, seeing as it\\'s only one stamina, but I\\'m sure there\\'s combinations left. \\n\\nThe conclusion I\\'m drawing is that either that thing hates me, or lack of native Wall is screwing me. I have the tools, I know I do. So, help?\\n\\nNotable characters and SB:\\n\\nPecil, Saint\\'s Fall \\n\\nGreg, Repentance and Brofist \\n\\nAerith, Pulse of Life\\n\\nYuna, HotF \\n\\nEiko, Flames of Rebirth\\n\\nPenelo, War Dance \\n\\nTidus,  Swiftform and Spiral Cut\\n\\nZidane, Scoop Art\\n\\nEdgar, Drill\\n\\nRamza, Shout\\n\\nVivi, Doublecast Decay\\n\\nGarnet, Leviathan and DG\\n\\nLeon, HotE\\n\\nStrago, Soul Sabre  (underleveled)\\n\\nAshe, Heaven\\'s Wrath\\n\\nQuistis, MG\\n\\nSquall, Fated Circle \\n\\nTifa, Dolphin Blow\\n\\n...and maybe a few spares I forgot. That\\'s why I\\'m frustrated; I know I have good SB and decent hones. I\\'m light on Celerity users, so Dismissal is hard to utilize. I think I have orbs to hone a second one, but I\\'m pretty sure that I\\'d have one at r3 and the other at r2, plus that locks me into using Tidus and his underwhelming single hit SB.\\n\\nThough I\\'m probably set for WHM (and SMN...) Abyss, that doesn\\'t help me now. x.x\\n\\nSuggestions, please? I roflstomped Seifer and Co only to get brickwalled by THIS asshat.\\n\\n Lmao! \\n\\nPretty sure that all rules were followed. \\n\\nAlmost as sure that they may be modified now. :p They Remedy Blind off fairly quickly and the only thing it stops is auto attacks, and Seifer is flat immune to Blind. I wouldn\\'t bother with it unless the attack you\\'re using has merits above and beyond just Blind.  Can always take her with a Drawtaliator duo into Sundaily.\\n\\nShe\\'ll level fast if you can keep her alive. Disciplinary Committee. Jerks. XD The strategy i outlined was similar to the one I used, except I used P.Cecil, whose Defense is likely superior to Agrias\\'. Her main benefit is that she can utilize white magic as well as spellblades, along with Cleansing Strike.\\n\\nIf Steiner has the higher Def, and remember that Draw Fire grants a 200% increase, then use him. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to break down MPO, and really, nobody does, if you\\'re hitting weaknesses 3* spellblades deal sufficient damage and you\\'ll get far more mileage out of them simply due to orb costs. \\n\\nAlso, DF isn\\'t a necessity. Few of the trio\\'s attacks are vulnerable to Taunt, just their auto attack. I used it with Lionheart on Cecil to fuel Saint\\'s Fall and a single Rampart. He was taking about 600 per autohit, which was almost immediately healed from high regen via MG. Again, he has a giant HP pool, so others may not have that advantage. \\n\\nMagical mitigation is the.most important due to the nasty AoEs tossed by Seifer and Fujin.  If you\\'re wanting one for the Portal App, you can create one for free on SE\\'s website. The site itself is about as intuitive and user-friendly as a dead elephant, but you should be able to find the link near the top.\\n\\n Edgar cannot. Paladins with 4* White are, I think, Cecil, Agrias, and Beatrix. How do you record something on your phone? Noob question, yes, but I have a pretty fair mage team and would like to try. Hmm. \\n\\nAgrias - DF/Shellga \\n\\nAerith- Curaja/Protectga\\n\\nExdeath, maybe... Blizz/Thundaga\\n\\nLeon- LS/Armor Break\\n\\nZack- Aeroga Strike/Bioga Strike\\n\\nYou\\'d be superbuffing Agrias and Zack\\'s SB. Packing a Wall is highly recommended. \\n ........\\n\\n............\\n\\nWhat did I just watch, r4 Quick Hits and Saint\\'s Crosses and what did i just WATCH?! Pretty much this. I packed MG, Protectga, and RW Wall..and still had to use Cecil\\'s Rampart to bridge during Fujin\\'s weak phase because Tornado freaking HURTS with just Shellga.\\n\\nKnights are wonderful against physical attacks but god, their RES is balls. I got a Greater Fire Orb, husband got Major Power and I cussed him out. Give your Draw Fire\\'er the Galbadian Elite; it should boost his DEF into the stratosphere. You\\'ll want a Protectga on Y\\'shtola, but even then just using Garnet instead of a Wall it\\'s gonna hurt when they nuke you.\\n\\nYou can slap  Shellga onto Agrias, and use her as a Draw Fire magnet, giving her the best Defense you have.  Then explain how you keep losing accounts, please. I\\'d like to know how that happens, because to my knowledge it can\\'t unless you overwrite your current account somehow. \\n\\nAnd if that\\'s what you keep doing, it\\'s either intentional or you\\'re incredibly dumb. RNG is RNG,  and from what I\\'ve seen, every one of the Ultimates can screw you with it.\\n\\nTriply so for those with 3 enemies. \\n\\n In my opinion, it\\'s better to have multiple r3 uses rather than 4 r4 or 2 r5. Sure, they hit hard and look pretty, but they do jack if they\\'re sitting there grey while you try to white damage an Ultimate. \\n\\nRS helps, but isn\\'t 100% necessary if you have enough native 5* to kit your team.\\n\\nI suggest, and this is without knowing all your team:\\n\\nTyro, SG, either magic with -gas or r3 spellblades for physical \\n\\nYuna, HotF, highest tier cure/ProShellga, make sure somebody else has the other one\\n\\nBest support character you have using at least Armor Break/down..Ramza with Armor Breakdown and Lifesiphon was what I used\\n\\nTwo heaviest DDs. Preferably with nonelemental single target SB, Lifesiphons, and someone to tote the spare element Tyro doesn\\'t have.\\n\\nRW Boostga ...edit, you have Shout, RW something else, Cleansing Strike or MG or something else useful\\n\\nKill Fujin first, she\\'s evil and can and will Tornado your group for a metric effton of damage. Building up your SB gauges, pop boostga, and try to burn her down in a round or two if you can.  Then take Seifer out,  keeping all mitigation up or else his Firagas and Zantetsuken Reverse will wipe you. Raijin is the least dangerous of the three and is sort of pathetic on his own. Thanks, gentlemen  (?), for the advice. I\\'ve been able to clear U/U+ since the FFT banner smiled on me and gave me Shout, but yes, I could use to r2 Full Break and stuff. I\\'ve recently been posting here with whatever advice I think will help,  and I\\'ve helped my husband, who also plays, to utilize his team more effectively and clear endgame challenges using many strategies I found here, as well as cursing his luck for having SG when I don\\'t. XD\\n\\nI\\'m gonna have to break down and start expanding my invo soon, though. \\n\\nThanks again! Kind of a dumb question, maybe...\\n\\nWhat do I do now that I\\'ve finished all story dungeons?  I think I read that an update is coming on the 10th, so there\\'s that, but my flow of mythril is going to be reduced to events now, and I\\'m worried that will cause me to fall behind due to inevitable power creep from relics that I won\\'t be able to obtain. I\\'m a f2p player, aside from Google Opinion Rewards, which gives me just enough to make the occasional 100 gem pull.\\n\\nDo I farm dailies, farm RM, stages, what?  Using characters you like is fine.\\n\\nJust don\\'t expect all of them to be /good/. There are certain characters who are just a liiiittle OP, and others that suck like an Electrolux  (coughEdwardcough).\\n\\nIf the way you get enjoyment out of the game is to use your favorites, then by all means, do it. As someone else stated, people clear stuff using just core jobs, no unique SB, realm synergy only, or any number of odd combinations. It\\'s your game, play how you want.\\n\\nThat said, if you\\'re using a set group of guys, be sure to give them the best abilities you can cobble together. That doesn\\'t mean all r4 or r5; if you run out of abilities 1/4 of the way through your boss fight then they\\'re not doing you the most good. Multiple uses of r3/r4 abilities will help you more than having two uses of almost any rank 5...Full Break being a notable exception. \\n\\nUsing 4*+ synergy gear is often better than blank 5*. I wish I\\'d known that, I sold so many 4* relics. \\n\\nRW selection will also be important when you use a set team. Shore up weaknesses and get a list of GOOD RW to choose from.\\n\\nAs always, have fun. We definitely could use an Aegis or Ochain for one of our paladins... Ace Striker, Battleforged, Black Mage\\'s Awakening, Paladin\\'s Devotion  (this is awesome on your WHM ), Dr. Mog, and probably gonna add Lionheart if it works out well enough. I use three at r3, on my three strongest DDs (usually P.Cecil, Greg, and Tidus/Squall/Edgar/Tifa/insert person here) and I generally have 3 full SB bars for a given elite, making boss fights very fast. I\\'m at 158 2/5.\\n\\nOnly been playing since the Cloud event with his dress record...Yeah I think I should put my phone down more >. < Thanks for your quick answer and advise re: Edgar as well as directing me toward the megathread; I will use that from now on. Darkmoon looks a LOT like the Samurai (well, Great Katana) weaponskill Tachi: Gekko from FFXI.\\n\\nIt even has the same added effect, silence. Since this post is already here, I figure I\\'ll ask for opinions also.\\n\\nI got a Drill awhile back. Should I bother with Edgar? I use two excellent Knights already, but his 5* Machinist is intriguing. The DEF boost would also be useful, and it\\'s the only relic I have that I lack the character for.  So far, 4x single pulls.. Inferno Dagger, Mesmerize Blade, and a freaking Basilisk Dagger from VII.\\n\\nOther pull was Garbage (tm) The video I saw used several SB, so you may have linked it incorrectly?  When I did Dr. Cid U+, I was Saint\\'s Fall-ing roughly every 2-3 turns using LS with Ace Striker.\\n\\nHoly weak U+ is a very very dead U+ My A-Team (abilities listed are those I use when no special requirements or elemental absorbs)\\n\\nPaladin Cecil, lv 75, SSB Saint\\'s Fall, Lifesiphon r3, Banishing Strike r4, Ace Striker\\n\\nGilgamesh,  lv 75, SB Repentance, SSB Faithful Companion,  Lifesiphon r3, Saint\\'s Cross r1, Battleforged\\n\\nTifa, lv 80, SSB Dolphin Blow, Lifesiphon r3, Tempo Flurry r4, The Zangan Way\\n\\nRamza, lv 72, SSB Shout, Full Break r1, Breakdown r2 (all my breakdowns are r2), Dr. Mog\\'s Teachings\\n\\nAerith, lv 66, SSB Pulse of Life, Curaja r4, ProShellga r2 (whichever is needed), Paladin\\'s Devotion \\n\\nThis team has enabled me to clear pretty much anything that can be stabbed rather than blown up. I almost always RW a Wall, since I don\\'t have one. Pyroclasm, despite its name and appearance, is definitely not fire based. My husband has it in his account and I spammed it against elite Belias, who absorbs fire. It wrecked him as normal.\\n\\nAs a SSB, it\\'s basically Shift Break v2.0, on a character who totes Breakdowns instead of Machinist shots. Plus, until Zidane gets his MC2 later this month, he\\'s stuck at 65, while Vaan can reach 80. \\n\\nIt isn\\'t bad at all, and paired with Steal Power or Shout, it\\'s pretty darn good.  I killed them myself, but I blinded two after I killed the third. Full Break + RW SG ensured that Water Spout was a light tickle, easily healed by Gilgamesh and his Faithful Companion. \\n\\nI saved the second use of SG for when Bergan magic rages at around 40%, and burst him down with Shout-assisted SBs.\\n\\nFairly simple fight. The Curaga wasn\\'t a thing, it didn\\'t heal enough to outpace my r4 + r2 Banishing Strikes, plus Cecil\\'s SSB, plus Spiral Cut, and then Greg\\'s Repentance and Faithful Companion. \\n\\nI slapped a r2 Reflect on Cecil, using it in the beginning, and Cid\\'s pets decided not to Regen him for the rest of the fight even after I dispelled Reflect. \\n\\nTwo medals lost, one dmg one action, mastery obtained and MPOs nommed into Full Break, which is now permanently affixed to Ramza. I started right around when you did and currently at 157 2/5; however, I am a stay at home mom whose kids are all in school and basically can play whenever I want.\\n\\nYou\\'re only behind if you think you\\'re behind. I personally think I may have advanced a bit too quickly, as I am now finding that I have to rely on events rather than the handful of elites I have remaining. \\n\\nI\\'m happy, though; I can clear U/U+ now with a minimum of S/L, I have some decent gear, and just made Meteor and Full Break this evening. /dance\\n\\nAlways recall this is a game, for entertainment. You\\'re not in competition with anyone except your digital enemies. Mastery obtained for Bergan.\\n\\nParty (on mobile and Reddit noob, so tables are a mystery to me)\\n\\nP.Cecil, lv74 (LS6/Protectga4, SOLDIER Strike)\\n\\nZidane, lv65 (Blind Shell4/Confuse Shell4, Battleforged)\\n\\nAerith, lv52 (Curaja10/Shellga4, Paladin\\'s Devotion)\\n\\nGilgamesh, lv73 (LS6/Banishing Strike8, Thief\\'s Code)\\n\\nRamza, lv70 (Magic Breakdown4/LS6, Dr. Mog)\\n\\nRW: Sentinel\\'s Grimoire\\n\\nNotable Gear: Demonsbane, 6* Judicer\\'s Staff\\n\\nNotable SB: Saint\\'s Fall, Scoop Art, Pulse of Life, Faithful Companion, Repentance, Shout\\n\\nPaladin\\'s Devotion is Paladin Cecil\\'s third RM, and on first glance seems sort of meh. Toss it on your healer, though, and with proper mitigation it heals more than you take, ensuring that your squishy WHM doesn\\'t take any premature dirt naps.\\n\\nThe fight itself I almost won first try; i was unprepared for Judge Bergan\\'s magic rate after he hit about 45%.\\n\\nTactics used: Open fight utilizing SG, Pro/Shell, then Shout. Zidane used Blind Shell on Bergan to open, which had an excellent proc rate. After Blind stuck, shoot one of the fodder Judges with Confuse Shell. Meanwhile, Ramza Magic Breakdown\\'d Bergan, and my other DDs charged SB by slapping a non-Confused judge around.\\n\\nAerith Curaja\\'d when necessary. After the first SG wore, I used Cecil\\'s Rampart as a bridge during the mop-up of the adds. They died quickly enough, leaving me with a second SG that I used only after Bergan was at 50% HP, providing me with the mitigation to withstand his Multi-Spells.\\n\\nMVP was Pulse of Life- The reraise effect made me lose no medals even though Aerith ate an entire Multi-Dark. Answered, MBO and levels for my 50s. :D I \"lived\" through Nightmare Crushdown via Pulse of Life once....\\n\\nIt starts using a 9999 wreck-your-shit single target attack afterward, meaning that it\\'s theoretically possible to win. Getting Platinum Sword, 1000%.\\n\\nBefore that, I used a pretty decent mage/summoner team that blew up the world, but now, yeah, I built up the few melee I had and now almost exclusively use them. \\n\\nI can now clear U and U+ with this team, so I\\'m happy.\\n\\nRamza is my waifu, can call him that cause he\\'s clearly a trap. XD. And girls can have waifu too. All my WHMs but Garnet have a medica  (reraise with Aerith and Eiko), but my Garnet has both DG and Leviathan...which is likely not usable in this event.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll get Penelo\\'s Holy Rod thingie. Yay Ashe\\'s sword... an addition to Seeks\\' Team BLM. I read someplace that Arise works wonders on this boss, is that true?\\n\\nIf so, my MWO supply will go to nothing to make this.\\n\\nI have a decent WHM team (Aerith, Eiko, Garnet, Penelo, Yuna), all with unique SB, so I am looking forward to this one. I got Shout on a 5 mythril pull, so yeah. They can, if it triggers. I love when it happens when using Maduin. I did the same thing with FO, but I used native Shout and five characters, so my hat is off to you, sir/ma\\'am.  For me, it\\'s Gilgamesh. I got his Zantetsuken and was like...well, guess I\\'ll grab him from the Hall. I didn\\'t know how good he was until afterwards. \\n\\nTwo weeks later I get Genji Blade. Yeah, he almost never leaves my party now, he\\'s an awesome character.\\n\\nLucky banner gave me a crap SB for Tidus, after I had gotten twin Seeker Shields. Too bad Brotherhood is fail...but I was using him so I could obtain his last RM anyway -.-\\n\\nMy husband gets stalked by Yuffie items. Two headbands, two Pinwheels. He doesn\\'t even like using her....\\n I use a full physical team for most things. Honing stuff like the Samurai abilities (if you have someone to use them) and Bladeblitz  (I think that\\'s the name) can clear trash just as effectively as a Ruinga if your dudes can hit hard enough.\\n\\nKick is also good if you have a good monk. \\n\\nThose are fairly GPO intensive, though, so if you lack them, it could be an issue. Finally beat this thanks to watching my husband wreck it with his weaker team (Fenrir Overdrive is so good here).\\n\\nTeam: Ramza lv 70, shiruken8, Launch 6, Shout, Dr. Mog \\n\\nGreg lv 73, Blade Bash10, Saint Cross2, Thiefs Code\\n\\nTifa lv 80, Lifesiphon6, Tempo Flurry8, Battleforged\\n\\nPecil lv 73, Lifesiphon6, Banishing Blade8, SOLDIER Strike\\n\\nTyro lv 66, Curaja10, Protectga4, some WHM curing RM\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have Wall. Done with no AoE heal other than Celebration Grimoire, which totally doesn\\'t count.\\n\\nI had Greg and Pecil use my RW Fenrir Overdrive in succession, while Tifa Lifesiphoned her way into her SSB. Both Greg and Pecil also have their SSB. Ended with one dead, mastery anyway.\\n\\nThank you to the RW with FO.  1/11, stupid Brotherhood I think, Tidus\\' one hit SB.\\n\\nI mean, I\\'ve been using him, but yuck.\\n\\nHusband went 0/11 and is less than amused.  I did it with RW SS2, Power Breakdown (not sure if help), Protectga, and about 25 s/ls until he didn\\'t Mako Spammon me to death unexpectedly. \\n\\nDidn\\'t hurt having Greg, Tifa, and Pecil\\'s SSB boosted by Shout, either. \\n\\nDark Nation is kind of a joke, it died almost right off the bat. Rufus is the pain in the ass.\\n\\nRandom Note: Shellga/DG did zilch to reduce it, don\\'t bother.  Right now, just FFXI. My character name is the same as my username here, and I\\'m on Bahamut server. Confirm that he hits like a truck. I haven\\'t won yet, working on it (but did master Rufus!), and I was gonna slap Drawtaliate onto Greg since I can cheese the BLM using Vivi\\'s RM3 on my healer.\\n\\nWall highly recommended, those constant counters suck and as mentioned can wreck even a Knight. \\n\\nI tried a mage/summoner team and his resistance is insane...luckily, it\\'s 1 mythril, so I can mess with my party. I didn\\'t bring Mental Breakdown, nor do I possess a Faithga outside of Garnet\\'s Leviathan, so YMMV. ....Okay that\\'s awesome. Thank you for the info! Hate me now, I got a 5* today... Aerith\\'s Wizard Rod.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve only been playing for 2mo. And I don\\'t have Aerith...\\n\\nI\\'d have screenshotted it if I knew how to do it in my phone, I\\'m too old for that junk. Pecil\\'s Lustrous Sword. I pulled it and was happy, went and blew a Soul in unlocking him because I\\'m only a 2 month old Keeper, and I swear he hasn\\'t left my party since....except when a boss absorbs Holy. It\\'s an amazing SB and an amazing character.\\n\\nMy first 5* was in a character I didn\\'t like at all. I got Tifa\\'s Master Fist and it sat for awhile, because EWWW TIFA. Then I realized that I should probably be using a SSB...she\\'s now my only lv 80 character.\\n\\nOf course, obligatory Platinum Sword reference because it transformed the way I play. I used a mage meta beforehand. Celes in 6 dungeons, with a rod, actually nukes fairly well.\\n\\nI suggest trying to make Greg your tank, using Magic Lure, and the rest of your team as nukers. Yuna\\'s HotF should be sufficient for group heal, but a Shellga/Protectga could really help, even at r1. Kefka will be your booster and primary nukage. If you have access to a second healer that could help you as well, carrying a reflect and a cure.\\n\\nTyro, while his stats suck, is extremely versatile. \\n\\nDeath has no place here, and if you\\'re using Celes as a BLM, then back row her and don\\'t use spellblades.\\n\\nI realize that you may not have all the things recommended by others if you\\'re new. I helped my husband clear this event with his mid-50s team, but it took a lot of work and a Wall RW. Oh snap, 3 mythril.\\n\\nGuess I\\'m saving. Considering I have done 10 5-myth pulls in a row on the recent banners and have zilch to show for it...saving. I wasn\\'t able to clear the last one, we\\'ll see about this. Tentative team, assuming I don\\'t pull some awesome relic in the meantime...\\n\\nPecil 71, SC2/ProShell4, Saint\\'s Fall\\n\\nTifa 80, LS6/Tempo Flurry 8, Dolphin Blow\\n\\nGilgamesh 68 (?), some random abilities, Companion\\n\\nYuna 67, Curaja8/whatever Cecil doesn\\'t have4, HotF\\n\\nRamza 69, idk what cause you said breakdowns fail, Shout\\n\\nHopefully I can gain some xp in there someplace to boost my guys up. I have access to Penelo with War Dance and Break Fever, I may kick Ramza if I need extra heals.\\n\\nI better have a wall RW too /cry'"

       "'And she always writes songs and plays being the underdog when she grew up wealthy.  Not rich.  Wealthy.  At no point in her life was she an underdog.\\n\\nGod I fucking hate her and everything she stands for and what she stands for is bullshit.  \\n\\nBut.... dem gams doe.   People do good deeds without expecting anything in return.  If you are a good person, you do good things without any expectation of gratitude or getting something from it.   FUCKING THANK YOU.  I knew i wasn\\'t the only one.  The balls on these guys who say that sexism against men is just as bad as sexism against women.  Please, as a guy, I feel that if I lose a job or a place in college or whatever to a woman based solely on sex, I\\'m entirely okay with it.  Women still make considerably less than men who do the same exact job and are grossly mistreated.  Women who accuse men of rape are sometimes driven out of town and ridiculed and harassed for being the victim.  These bitch ass dumb shit \"men\" need sit the fuck down and learn some goddamn history.   Crazy is an ableist slur but I can\\'t find the words. Unless your husband is The Rock and has a very very distinct body type, imma say chill.  Yea. Kids from different backgrounds sometimes give themselves Western names because they are tormented as kids about the names from their cultural backgrounds. Maybe, in order to fit into a new country and to not be made fun of by awful children, Kamaru Usman wanted to be called Marty. But sure, Kamaru Usman should be totally excoriated for this.  And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why I am an agnostic.  I don\\'t care if my SO wants our kids to celebrate Christmas or Kwanza.   I know you religious nuts are gonna jump on me but fuck all of you.  Look at this guy, religion is potentially going to cause him to leave a girl he loves.  Some of you are gonna give me this bullshit about how spirituality and compatibility are a huge issue but guess what, if no one gave a shit, this wouldn\\'t be an issue.  \\n\\nCelebrate Christmas and Yom Kippur and Kwanza and Hannukah and Rosh Hashanah and Scientology day.  Just celebrate all of them what the fuck do you care.  If you love this girl, you should be willing to give up anything for her.  If you aren\\'t, then you don\\'t love this girl that much in the first place.   She doesn\\'t need to know but it would be nice if you told her?  Maybe?  \"teen porn\" isn\\'t underaged.  These girls are 18 and over but look much younger.  It\\'s not particularly my cup of tea (i like boobies) but there are a lot of legitimate porn companies that do that genre of porn.  However, if these girls are clearly obviously 100% underaged, then you need to alert the authorities and break off the engagement.  Ain\\'t nobody got time for no pedophile.  But be sure, 100% sure, beyond positive before you go accusing.  Being accused of being a pedophile is basically the same as being a pedophile to the public\\'s eye.   Why crush her? You really only want to tell her because you need to get it off your chest.  Let it be your burden to bear and let her live how she lives.  \\n\\nNote: Not a therapist, I would consult in a professional.  One time, when I was 14, I was walking home and I heard this barking sound.  I was normally not afraid but this was louder than normal and I hear the chainlink fence rattling.  Suddenly, I hear it open and I take off running and...\\n\\nwait...\\n\\nI thought you said Dog.  My B.  God ain\\'t real.   20 year old.  Boxers usually don\\'t make it to that age and even if they do, the mental degradation is intense.  \\n\\nIn all out combat, 20 year old wins easily.  In straight boxing, 20 year old quickness will always be too much to overcome.  \\n\\nBoxing is a sport of centimeters.  Anticipation and skill are super important but when your ability to slip a punch is slowed by a quarter of a second, you\\'re getting hit.  \\n\\nBoxing and combat sports are tough sports.  The athletes know what they are getting into and it is astounding the sacrifices they make for our bloodlust and enjoyment.  \\n\\n Chinese people and Japanese people don\\'t speak the language.  I\\'m just so incredibly here for the title of this post.  Just ignore it.  She\\'ll soon see that there is no age difference in reality.   Let me preface this by saying he missed weight by 1.2 pounds and NYSAC is a total fucking joke anyways but given the 2 hour extension, no doubt in my mind DC makes weight.  \\n\\nAnd furthermore, 1.2 pounds didn\\'t affect the fight. \\n\\nThe rule that I have been told that he broke was that he may (or may not) have used the assistance of holding onto the towel to make weight.  \\n\\nAgain, it doesn\\'t matter.  Anthony Johnson wrestling with DC means DC wins 10 out of 10 times.   Cheating is pretty much the only answer.  It\\'s called a sexually transmitted infection for a reason.  Lucky for you, it\\'s curable.  However, your relationship is not treatable and you must remove it from your life.   apologize profusely, make it up with sex, apologize more.  basically act really canadian.  But if you\\'re doing a good deed, you don\\'t care about the \"manners\" of others.  If, lets say for example, a starving man took a piece of bread from you and didn\\'t say thank you, would you regret giving him the bread?  No, you don\\'t care whether or not people say thank you if you do somethign from the goodness of your heart.  Tenshin is Japanese. Jackie Chan is Chinese.  Not racist at all.  You guys aren\\'t crazy, stupid, love crazy, you guys are people who loved crazy, stupid, love crazy.  And it seems like you kids will be alright.   After living fairly close to the Scientology HQ, I can say that they don\\'t really bother anyone and their security cameras really improve the parking safety of the streets around the building.  I haven\\'t gone inside nor have I ever talked to anyone part of the organization but I can very honestly say that they don\\'t really cause much trouble or proselytize much. \\n\\nBasically like any other religion except they all dress in the same uniform, hang around the same place, and definitely feel cult-ish.   If you are a girl, you can ask him out.  He will say yes because you are a girl who has just asked him out.\\n\\nUnless he already has a girlfriend in this case he will still say yes ut keep you on the downlow No thanks.  okay, colonizer.  Non-white and/or poor republicans.  You guys are all voting against your own self interests and don\\'t even realize it.  Rich, white republicans, however, totally get it.   I mean... for this current title rain, you are correct but Dillashaw did defend 2 other times.  God the NRA needs to shut their face.  How is requiring people to quickly report missing or stolen guns against the second amendment?  Shut up! I say we finish 11-5.  We might slip up somewhere other than Seattle and NO.  Maybe we slip up against the falcons even though they are horrible.  Seattle is almost surely going to win the division at this point but it doesn\\'t matter.  The team that wins the superbowl is the team that is running hot.  I don\\'t see the 9ers winning it all this year because Seattle is hot but so are the saints and a few other NFC teams.   I am so disappointed.  I wanted outrageous stereotypes.  Alexis Maxwell is a pretty girl who goes to northwestern so she\\'s probably super smart.  And in her prettiness she probably works out a lot too so she\\'s probably super in shape.  Not even fair y\\'all.\\n\\nLook at J\\'tia Taylor.  She\\'s pretty, a nuclear engineer and looks like she can run a couple of miles.  \\n\\nOr how about Garrett Adelstein.  Abs for days on the brain tribe.  Jeez people, I wanted like a shit ton of cochrans vs Kat (No one wants to date someone who doesn\\'t make the merge Kat) vs Joel Anderson (Micronesia fireman)\\n\\nReally the only stereotypical tribe is the brawn tribe who straight up look dumb as balls. Not even being sarcastic or facetious but Yoel\\'s english is only 900 times more understandable than Till\\'s scouser accent. \\n\\nI LUHHHH JUUUUU BOIIIIIIIII Leaving Neverland was a bad doc that only had testimony and no hard evidence. It did not lay out a case against Michael Jackson nor was that the goal. \\n\\nIf you believed he did it before, you watch it and believe the vivid stories of James Safechuck and to a slightly lesser extent, Wade Robson. \\n\\nIf you didn\\'t believe that MJ did it, you can point to the lack of hard evidence or the build of a case in the doc. \\n\\nFor what it\\'s worth, I believed MJ was a rapist long before this doc and Leaving Neverland had no effect in swaying me either way tbh. \\n The use of victim vocabulary does not mean that there aren\\'t real victims and exploitation occurring.  How often do the people at your school use the words \"sick\" and \"bro\" but sadly never referring to a \"sick brother\"? Slow clap for good guy boyfriend.  Revenge is a dish best served cold.  Blooded.  Nice work bro.   Ehhhhhhh no.  Where the fuck do I even start with this. \\n\\nFirstly, your title is purposefully inflammatory to stoke a response by presenting it without context.\\n\\nSecondly, general crime, above all else, is dictated by geography (which is in turn dictated by wealth or lack thereof.) Hate crimes, while motivated by hate, are still a circumstance of geography.  Very rarely do people travel to far off neighborhoods to specifically commit crimes against certain groups of people although those stories tend to grab headlines.  \\n\\nTo my knowledge, there hasn\\'t been any conclusive or credible studies done on rates of hate crimes against Asians split by ethnicity of perpetrator.  Please enlighten me if there are these studies.  You can\\'t just make divisive statements without backing it up with any evidence. \\n\\nCrimes (those not motivated by race) are more affected by geographical location.  People who live in white neighborhoods are more likely to have crimes committed against them by white people.  People who live in black dominated neighborhoods are more likely to have crimes committed against them by black people.  \\n\\nThe racial tension between Asian and Black Americans is very real and documented.  It\\'s an issue both communities have to get together to work through.  However, your deranged and insanely stupid statement of \"why are you hitting us, hit white people\" stance is fucking dumb and you can suck my dick from the back. \\n\\nIf you ever decide to learn anything, you can take a look at the links below:\\n\\nhttp://www.lahumanrelations.org/hatecrime/reports/2015%20Hate%20Crime%20Report%20PDF.pdf\\n\\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/victims_final\\n\\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/offenders_final\\n\\n Why would anyone voluntarily live in DTLA? You guys broke up and she went and had a threesome with two guys?  Jesus christ girl, get it get it?  But dude, that\\'s some dirty shit.  I say stay away from this girl and run as far as possible.   It takes a big PR* person to recognize when they\\'re in the wrong.  Which her PR person was.  Boxing is not on the decline.............. I get it. There are deep seeded issues in all sports, particularly with American sports. (White owners, minority players)\\n\\nAt the end of all, we\\'re rooting for millionaires who work for billionaires playing a game where we all lose money and they all gain  money no matter how bad or good they are.  His proposed tax plan has the tax rate of 17% for someone making under $37,650 but 50% is close enough, I guess. \\n\\nWhatever, who cares, capitalism is going to die and China is going to rule anyway. China number 1, no other no 2.  First.... They broke up 10 years ago.  You need to either get over that or you need to leave him.\\n\\nSecondly, he identifies as Jackson.  Please address him as such.  Calling him Jill is actively insulting him.  \\n\\nThirdly, Jackson is a man.  Does your boyfriend like men?  You should probably figure that out because if he doesn\\'t like men, I don\\'t think there is any issue with him living with Jackson.  \\n\\nFourth, this entire post comes off less like \"I can\\'t stand my boyfriend hanging out with his ex\" and more like \"I don\\'t care about the ex part but trannies are yucky.\"\\n\\nFifth, seriously, stop masking this as being uncomfortable with your boyfriend\\'s ex.  You are uncomfortable that Jackson is Jackson and no longer Jill.  You self proclaimed \"traditionalist background\" is just what politicians say when they mean that they are not comfortable being around transgendered individuals.  That\\'s 100% on you and 0% on your bf.  \\n\\nFinal word: Break up with your boyfriend.  If you will never feel comfortable being around Jackson (whether it is because he is your BF\\'s ex or because he is a trans individual) then you might as well leave before the resentment builds even more.   That people who are against it don\\'t actually understand it.   I don\\'t think the refs called the best game on Sunday but I only think losers (grand scheme of things) complain about the refs.  We didn\\'t lose the game because of the refs, we lost because some qb ended the final three possessions with Fumble, INT, INT.  \\n\\nIn the superbowl against pittsburgh, seattle fans spent the next few months complaining that the refs called an unfair game.  Guess what, good teams overcome unfair refs.  I think that Seattle played the better game last Sunday and we were hit by really bad injuries and Kap turned the ball over three times to end the game.   I\\'m telling you, Marreta is the one. He will be the one who beats Jon.  I\\'m not black nor am I a Black American but I would imagine being shot for holding a cell phone in your back yard sucks pretty hard.  \\n\\nAnd also knowing, for a fact, that there will never be justice for killing an unarmed black person must suck as well.  Karen. Guisados has the best tacos in DTLA and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.  \\n\\n Again, everyone here is right.  I am wrong. But I\\'m going ignore those two facts as well as most facts.   That\\'s total bullshit.  Black people are allowed to say it, white people aren\\'t.  It\\'s not that difficult to comprehend.  It\\'s that simple.  Is it unfair? No because black americans have suffered through hundreds of years of oppression and they\\'ve more than earned the right to exclusively use a word.   Too many commas and grammatical errors\\n\\nHead over heels*    Went to his house many times*    Which brought on a fight*    Fueled by rage*    Couldn\\'t bear to lose her*    Looked through her phone*  drug addict*  (again) Which also went into far greater detail*    My little angel (unless she\\'s an angle)*    Needless to say*    I ended up*   threesome*   wedding (unless weeding is something in your tradition)*    Which (for the third time)*    \\n\\nMaybe she cheated on you because you can\\'t spell or write for shit?  Maybe she wanted someone who isn\\'t umm... how do you say... a dumbass.    \\n\\n\\n\\n Leave.  It\\'s not that she\\'s not worth your time and sure, it could be a huge mistake that she made on accident.  However, you are two damaged people who should concentrate on fixing yourselves rather than being together at the moment.  Maybe down the line, the two of you can be together but you need to call off the wedding.  The two of you should not be together.   So is it 5 or is it 6.  I mean those aren\\'t astronomical numbers.  I am entirely sure I know my exact number of past girlfriends if it was under 10 girlfriends.  Seriously, it\\'s bothering me.  Did you have 5 past girlfriends or 6 past gfs? That\\'s not how this works. Having charges dropped means prosecutors didn\\'t think they had enough evidence to win the case. \\n\\nThat literally actually doesn\\'t mean he didn\\'t do anything but it also doesn\\'t mean that he did do something. \\n\\nProsecutors don\\'t move forward or drop cases on whether or not they think someone did it, they do depending on the winnability of the case.  No such thing as \"walkable\" in LA.  Sorry, everything is travel by car no matter what other people say.  Sure you could live right next to the whole foods but that means your gym or your work or everything else will be a 45 minute walk away.  \\n\\nA two bedroom for 1600 is do-able, you could live in Culver City which is santa monica adjacent-adjacent-adjacent.  It\\'s not a bad area but the rent is cheap enough.  \\n\\nIf you are working in downtown LA, then you couldn\\'t live in Culver City because that, with a car, is an hour drive with traffic.  I guess for 1,600, you might be able to swing for a place in Silver Lake if you look closely enough.  It\\'s tough with the budget restrictions and the price you\\'re asking for along with the location.  LA is a giant place, you\\'re not going to avoid the traffic.  \\n\\nThe \"Queens\" of LA, to me, would either be Pasadena or Van Nuys.  Both of those aren\\'t in walking distance of downtown LA.  Hell, the drive to DTLA from those places are a hassle.   Dude reign of fire and law abiding citizen were awful.  RocknRolla was serviceable and 300 was good.  I\\'m not saying they are bad but they do a lot lot lot lot lot of shitty action movies.  I like the two of them but they need new agents.  Those jokes weren\\'t about her.  The joke about her, the one she took issue with, was the joke about staying away from Michael J Fox\\'s son.  \\n\\nHer response to that took place before Tina and Amy\\'s third time hosting the Golden Globes which was way after the Taylor Swift joke.   So your curtains have to be \"magenta\" not \"pink\"?\\n\\nEDIT: Innapprops.  I immediately denounce and reject myself.   You should respect her religion and let he live her unhappy life with the man that she doesn\\'t love or have any strong feelings towards just so she could service her parent\\'s will.  Because that sounds like a totally awesome way to live through life. \\n\\n-No one ever\\n\\nI don\\'t know where you live in, but if this is America, you march over to her parents house and give them a piece of your mind.  Seeing how you haven\\'t done this, you probably didn\\'t love/like her all that much anyway so might as well let her go.  \\n\\nIf you truly love this girl, you fight for her regardless of what her parents might think.  If she loved you, she wouldn\\'t ever consider marrying this random guy to appease her parents and her religion.  I know all these motherfuckers are now going to say that I have to respect other\\'s religion and such what and all I have to say to them is to suck my godless dick.  If your religion is so great, why do you have to give up on a man you love for a man your parents set up for you.  Isn\\'t the whole point in life to find your own happiness and to do what makes you happy?  I don\\'t see how giving up on a 1 and a half year relationship to marry some rando your parents like can make you happy.  \\n\\nIf you love her, fight for her.  Don\\'t let her marry this guy and be unhappy for the rest of your life.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to bother, you never loved her in the first place and she isn\\'t worth your time.  Move on.  You should break it off.  Those festering feelings of distrust will manifest itself into larger issues.  Ask yourself, can you trust her if she goes out with her friends and parties it hard?  Do you trust her if she is somewhere without you?  If you feel like she kissed back and you can\\'t trust her, you need to leave her.  It will be better for both of you and stop wasting time between the two of you.  That trust can\\'t be redeveloped.  It won\\'t be the same.   I feel like waterboarding yourself to own the libs absolves you of the sin of grabbing gloves. Yoel is obviously more at fault now until he waterboards himself.  So because you can\\'t tell the difference between Japanese people and Chinese people, it is okay to call a Japanese person \"Jackie Chan\"? Logic checks out. Cool.  Just bear with him.  Cut off all sex with him.  Siphon money out of him and then a week before the wedding break it off with him but really remember this, KEEP THE RING!  It\\'s yours legally (depending on where you are.  Hopefully it\\'s america).   You Belong With Me.  Mean.  Her entire existence.   It\\'s also probably a bad sign that you view your relationship as a contract, social or otherwise.  Note: This article is actually from Fox News.  Check the author of the article.  Of course Fox hates LA, LA is everything that Fox stands against.  Bastion of acceptance whether you\\'re gay or straight, black or white, tall or less tall.  The only thing Fox hates that LA hates as well are ugly people.   WHAT??? 6 months???  That chick cray yo.  Seriously, if a girl was talking to me about marriage and potentially having kids at 6 months, I would run the other way so fast, I\\'d pass by her a couple of times as i circumnavigated the world.  I\\'d be worried that she might get knocked up at this point.  If you really think you aren\\'t ready for kids, you should sit her down, tell her and if she blows up on you, end the relationship.   Heroes vs. Villains.  How the FUCK do those bitter fucks not vote for Parvati to win?  Sandra?  Really?  Sandra??  I can\\'t even watch that season again without getting physically mad at the world.   How about stop considering whether or not this is harmful or anything and just do it because you love your fiance and this is a small thing that she would like you to stop doing?  For her?  Not to say pick your battles because relationships are about listening to each other and compromising but seriously, pick your battles.  \\n\\nThis is a small thing to cut down drinking a few days a week to make your fiance, the woman you supposedly love, happy, why not do it even if you don\\'t view it as something harmful  \\n\\n**TL;DR** If you love your girlfriend and shes asking to cut back on drinking, do it because you love her.   Do not get into a situation that doesn\\'t involve you.  I always get downvoted for saying this but the right thing to do is to remove yourself from the situation.  This doesn\\'t concern you, move on, worry about your own life.  It is not your perogative to tell Greg, it is Leon and Sally\\'s so GO AWAY.  Not your problem, don\\'t insert yourself to create more dramz.  Entirely serious.  I attribute men complaining about sexism towards men the same way as white people who complain about racism towards white people.  Men don\\'t even begin to know how good they have it and once they get just a tiny bit unequal on their part, we start bitching like maniacs.  We men are literally just a bunch of bitch ass pussies.  It\\'s basically like rich kids complaining about discrimination against rich people.  Yea everyone hates you flaunting your cash but guess what, at the end of the day, you\\'re rich and everyone else is poor.   If Jacksons\\' gender identity wasn\\'t an issue, why mention it at all? lol psych eval for a cop. I needed a good laugh today.  Well, rick, you done fucked up.  (Rick springfield reference.  google it)  But, you know what, fuck your friend, if you like this girl and this girl likes you, your friend is gonna have to suck it.  It\\'s a bad thing you did but sometimes if the two of you like each other, you two like each other, it can\\'t be helped.\\n\\nYou should tell your friend (you will lose him as your friend) but I would definitely give it a go with this girl.  That\\'s the romantic in me.  Uhhh... I don\\'t know how to say this but uhhh... your SO was getting himself to pictures of other girls.  I\\'m sure you have nothing to worry about because guys really just get off on weird things and your SO\\'s weird thing might be random pics of girls on okcupid.   Your boyfriend is just full of win in this update.  Good for the both of ya, what a good way to end mighty dramz.   Yes but Arizona has very racist immigration policies.  Also, since when was calling someone a racist considered a \"racist remark\"??  Also Arizona is definitely a racist desert wasteland.   Not racist at all.  First half no, second half definitely.  \\n\\nDogs and cats can coexist.  There is nothing biological about dogs wanting to hunt down cats.  That\\'s fiction.  Some dogs are more aggressive towards cats because they are an aggressive dog.  \\n\\nHowever, the fact that you are uncomfortable around dogs is very reasonable.  He should be respectful of your pass experiences and the emotional distress it would cause you.  \\n\\n You can\\'t make people cheat on you, people who cheat will cheat regardless.  You should not tell his SO because this is not your problem.  Clear your conscience of it because, while you may be at fault somewhat, the onus lies on your \"friend\", the cheater.  It is his job not to cheat, not your job not to help him cheat.   If this is a luxury hotel chain that caters to the wealthy, the only guilt you should feel is that you didn\\'t steal more from them  hahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaha How did you feel about Measure B passed in LA? On a scale of 1 to full on virgin, how seldom do you get laid? If you are complaining about a sudden loud sound warning you that a child is abducted, you are a bad person.  Nope.  It\\'s not a revenge tour until we beat seattle in seattle.  We\\'ve lost to all three of the teams still left on the NFC side.  Beating Seattle at home, to me, isn\\'t a big deal at all.  The big deal is to beat Seattle in Seattle in the playoffs.   He\\'s Batman.  He won\\'t.   Not his business at all.  It isn\\'t your obligation to tell him what you did when you were broken up.  If you feel comfortable telling him, you can do that but don\\'t ever feel obliged to disclose anything you did while you were broken up or even when you were together.  You two are no longer in a relationship, you have no responsibility to let him know everything.   My favorite is Boston Rob.  It seems stereotypical but as a long time analyzer of his game there are more reasons than his diabolical nature.  He is my favorite player but not, in my opinion, the best player (I would have to give that to Parvati).  I like Rob because his ability to play the game without getting his emotions involved.  To paraphrase him, if you set a line you aren\\'t going to cross, you spend the entire time on the island juggling between whether or not you will cross that line. Furthermore, he seems to have a great ability to get along with people\\n\\nHowever, the one reason I have him as my favorite is that he made the greatest move in survivor history.  He lost the million dollars to Amber and then married amber.  basically, he won that million dollars anyway.   Bro... I feel so bad for you man.  Really though, good luck.  The only advice I can give is that you just tell her that you\\'ll stop talking to this girl and there was never anything going on.  Apologize profusely and beg for forgiveness even though, theoretically, you did nothing wrong.  \\n\\nSorry man, I feel for ya.  \"Is English your first language?\" is kinda not okay for a teacher to ask 3 months before the end of the school year. It is especially insulting if the OP/student is a person of color. I am by no means a TAM apologist. I think they are a camp that can help a fighter become good and adequate but they probably won\\'t be able to take a good fighter and make them elite.  That\\'s what I\\'m trying to say but really, it\\'s pointless to debate people in general. Facts don\\'t change minds.  In reality, yes. If you are a white male in America, you are entitled to many advantages over others in America.  Transgenerational. Benefit of doubt in eyes of the law. Job opportunities. Not being redlined out of good neighborhoods. Chances of sexual assault and harassment are lower. \\n\\nShould they entitle you to anything? Probably not but it does.  Lay down the fucking law.  Look, if we could have it our way, all of us guys want to sleep with every woman he finds hot.  We don\\'t do it because we love our significant others and we know it would destroy them because of it.  We also don\\'t have open relationships because us guys are selfish and we don\\'t want our SO\\'s to sleep with other guys.  \\n\\nSo you, need to lay down the goddamn law.  Tell your boyfriend \"Sorry, you ain\\'t sleeping with other women.  That\\'s the deal with relationships.  You and I love each other and we\\'re going to sleep with each other because I don\\'t want you sleeping with some hussy.  Yes, I used the term hussy.\" Triggered.  She ain\\'t a hero, she just has good policy points and is assertive and is playing the game well right now.  Name-calling means ya burnt.  Exactly this moment 1 year and some change in, it\\'d be the same. Of the very very few things Trump has done, almost all of those are low immediate impact, disastrous long term impacts.  Hillary wouldn\\'t have saved the country and it\\'s march towards oblivion but she would\\'ve extended the lifespan by at minimum 10 fold.  What type of poppycock is this?  It\\'s called a warrant. Just making sure you have that information.   Ooh, darlin you were blind to let him go.  Now you see him in her arms, you want him back.   Rakim is up there.  Ice Cube\\'s pen game is underrated.  It\\'s tough.  I mean, Kendrick is making a statement right now as the lyricist to beat right now.  But I think, at the end of it all, I have to go with Nas.  Illmatic... it\\'s tough to beat.   Who do you think the rumored caped crusader saving people in New York was? Some magical fairy dust alien? No, that was me!  It\\'s low but he\\'s leading republicans right now.  It\\'s tough because common sense says that there\\'s no chance but he is running and he is leading so there is a 4% chance he wins.  \\n\\nHowever, unless America is truly that fucked, in a general election, Trump will get demolished.  He has lost pretty much all the Latino vote and the non-racist white vote.  Fox News isn\\'t really on his side since he\\'s gotten into a tiff with Megyn Kelly.  No sane republican politician (there are like 3 of them total) would back him.  Hillary or Bernie can definitely beat Trump as well.   Very reasonable.  Talk to him about it and how it makes you feel.  Explain everything you did here.   Firstly, suicide attempt rates are roughly similar between men and women but success rate on men is higher because they tend to use methods such as guns and hangings while women use pills which are not as effective.  \\n\\nSecondly, feminism addresses a specific issue which is equality between women and men.  Do you run into a cancer benefit and start asking people why they aren\\'t caring about heart attack rates?  \\n\\nThirdly, the perception IS WRONG.  There is no \"militant marxist lesbian\" wing of feminism that actually matters.  Most feminists are just normal people who want an equal society.  That matters that it\\'s an incorrect perception.  \\n\\nFourthly, earlier death in men is not exactly something that can be solved.  That is a biological reality of nature.  Males tend to die before females and is not due to the fault of humankind.  \\n\\nFifthly, bias against fathers in domestic splits and the negative perception of stay at home dads are actual issues that FEMINISTS are also fighting against.  Those are real issues and they need to be addressed but feminists aren\\'t taking opposite sides of it, it is just not the priority for them nor should they be.\\n\\nSixth, a single injustice does not mean that massive injustice exists.  Feminists fought for women\\'s suffrage.  Feminists fought for Title IX.  \\n\\nWe don\\'t live in a world where women have overwhelming power and are creating a culture where they are dominant over men.  We live in a world where men are dominant over women significantly.  If we lived in a world where women had all the advantages of men, then feminism would be the wrong side to take but we don\\'t.   Let\\'s place limits.  Only Presidents after Lincoln.  When you consider the abolition of slavery with Lincoln, creating the country with Jefferson and Washington, you can\\'t really make clear arguments.\\n\\nSo with those rules, I would go with FDR.  He pretty much is the greatest modern President in America\\'s history.  Saved the country.   Because, like most other racists and bigots, them bitches be dumb.   If cops killing unarmed black people at an alarming rate is fucking fucked up and Austin Rivers is on an NBA team is kinda fucked up, I\\'d say that Taylor Swift being #1 on Maxim\\'s Hottest list is pretty fucked up.  Because it\\'s not that she\\'s not attractive, she\\'s obviously very attractive but there are people that are very slightly attractiver.  I guess.  \\n\\nI\\'m gonna get in trouble for this.   You\\'re good.  No one wants to date a man who owns a cat anyways.   Only 100% right.  Test out the waters living together first so know if you are compatible.   Good luck! I got skewered here for offering 20 dollars to move literally 1.1 miles.  Like they skewered me.  Outright yelled at me over the internet for it.  Good luck, I hope you find someone and not be bothered by internet pricks.  So you live in the south? Illustrations in novels are for writers who aren\\'t good enough with words to paint a mental picture.  If you have to include illustrations in your work, your writing is not up to par.   How are the conditions similar in any way?\\nI\\'m not sure if you mean the 95 team of the 94 team but both are not at all similar to the one now.\\n\\nThe 94/95 team are an offensively concentrated team that had a dangerous passing attack.  \\n\\nThe 2014 team is a run first team and not a east/west runner, it is a north/south power running team.  \\n\\nThe 94/95 team had a qb (Steve Young) who was skilled in the west coast offense with an ability and arm strength to chuck it down field.  WC Basic rule is short passes with receivers capable of a lot of YAC.\\n\\nThe 2014 tries to run the WC offense but relies on heavy run and Kap\\'s downfield accuracy.  This team also has receivers incapable of YAC\\n\\nThe 94-95 (94 to 95) Niners were the #1 seed in the NFC and the Chargers were the #2 seed.  This year, they are both wild cards.  \\n\\nI don\\'t see how any of the conditions are the same.  For god\\'s sake, the superbowl is in the opposite of Miami (where the 95 bowl was held) this year.   I didn\\'t even want her to return the second time.  i wish they just sent her to exile island and kept her there.   Just at the end of the date, open your mouth as wide as possible, stick your tongue out and then lick the side of her face.  Shit totally works.   Trololololololololololololololololololololllllllll Just plant one on her.  Do it.  If she slaps you then you\\'ll know immediately that she isn\\'t interested and then you can go drink a shit ton of tequila and hook up with someone else.  If she tongues you back, then you\\'ll know you have scored.  Plus you\\'re gonna be drunk enough to be shameless about it all.   Trust me.... he isn\\'t hurting.   Pity bang?  Or you just say you don\\'t want a relationship outright.  either be 100% honest or be 100% deceptive.  Don\\'t middleground it because that never works out.   But there are justifiable losses.  Losing isn\\'t just losing.  There are differences between a 13-3 team and a 10-6 team when the 13 win team plays a much easier schedule compared to the 10 win team.  \\n\\nLosing at Seattle and losing to a very good Colts team is not a worrying loss.  It\\'s not time to panic yet.  Yet.  If we lost on Thursday to the Rams, it\\'s time to worry.  If we drop the Sunday Night game to Houston then it\\'s full on panic time.   I never understood the point of strip clubs.  It\\'s like paying for a cocktease.  Makes zero sense that you only get to look at titties without being able to touch and/or stick your face in them.  You\\'re boyfriend might have personal issues if he actually enjoys going to strip clubs a lot. Seriously, strip clubs are shady ass places and also make no sense to me.  I\\'m not 13, I dont just want to see titties, I can see titties anywhere.   i hate the fact that I\\'m not in chicago right now.  Hate it.   So women should not have equal rights and opportunities as men?  Is that how you feel? Not your problem.  She\\'s being a friend to her friend.  You don\\'t know the whole story with Monique, you don\\'t know how she\\'s feeling and what she does has nothing to do with you.  \\n\\nThis says nothing about your girlfriend other than she loves her friend, Monique and she\\'ll have her back even when she\\'s doing questionable things.  This says nothing about your relationships other than your girlfriend being loyal to her friend almost to a fault.  \\n\\nStop caring about this, this is Monique\\'s problem.  It\\'s not your problem  It\\'s not your girlfriend\\'s problem.   \"Pussy\" Don\\'t feel slutty.  Guys do this all the fucking time and we never feel slutty so you shouldn\\'t either.\\n\\nAlso, you are not in an exclusive relationship with either one of these guys so you can do what you want with your body. #GagaRKelly \\n\\nMy advice is to let it ride.  Keep going with the both of them until you feel strongly about either or one ultimatums you (yes, I use ultimatum as a verb).  If one of them wants to be in a relationship, you can decided to be exclusive with him or dump him but in the meanwhile, you have done nothing wrong.  Get it, get it gurl.   The solution is sooooo obvious.  hookers and blow.  Everyday all day, hookers and blow.   You\\'re completely right. Just wanted to add a little more:\\n\\nA choke, when applied correctly, is supposed to shut off blood, not air. In order to do that, you essentially have to clamp down on both sides of the neck, not the front. You can clearly see in the video that nothing is shutting off the blood on the left part of Weidman\\'s neck because Weidman\\'s arm is in. \\n\\nThis is still insanely uncomfortable and with a squeeze like pretty ass Luke Rockhold\\'s a scrub like me would tap but Chris Weidman is tough as fuck, he\\'s not gonna tap. \\n so cheesy.  Nick Diaz Jon Jones MSG make it happen Yea but you started with a 50% tax on $15 doll--- why am I even trying. China number 1, no other no 2.  I\\'m gonna be very offensive here so sorry, I have no self control.  Hopefully, the one on the right isn\\'t your mom but she\\'s a hottie boombalottie.   Evil Russell.  That guy can never win the game.  He burns bridges left and right without an regard to the finale.  He takes the brunt of every single blindside and embraces his evilness publicly.  He is a player that may get to the final tribal a lot more than other people but he can never, ever, ever win.   Sandra.  Fuck her.  Parv shoud have won.  Fuck her.  But shit, I don\\'t want candice there either but no.  Sandra.   >In some cases? I would consider being denied an education or work relative to a qualified applicant to be a pretty serious issue, yes\\n\\nI would not.  Because I know that the woman who got that job over me is getting criminally underpaid.  So yea, as a company, I would hire the woman too because I don\\'t have to pay her that much.  Also, I\\'ve dominated woman in every luxury ever, I get to stand up and pee, I\\'ll let them take my spot at UC Berkeley.   It smells like piss ALL the time.  Edit: Reorganization of argument. Yes, I am one of those people.\\n\\nYou cannot control how others act, only your own reaction to what is happening.  Prove you aren\\'t a trust fund kid by working hard and earning your keep.  Not ignore it, but accept that this is how they reacted and find a way to move on.  People will love you and hate you but those who matter should accept you for who you are. If they don\\'t, they don\\'t matter to you. \\n\\nHowever, part of me gets where they\\'re coming from. Haterade flows within my veins and when I was a broke boy, the haterade was potent. From strictly from a play-hater perspective which I am, the last thing I want to hear is some rich kid (or someone I perceive as rich) saying they struggled too.  \\n\\nWhat I rather hear, **which I have no right to demand and you have no obligation to say**, is \"Yes, I grew up with privilege and the benefit of this name. Some doors were probably opened for me without me actively knowing. I did not experience the same as many other lower income/impoverished people but we each had our struggles and I am trying to understand your struggle too\" \\n\\nAgain, you have no obligation to see it that way and I have no right to demand you see it that way.  Merely trying to show what I and many people who did not grow up with any trans-generational wealth anywhere near our families feel.  Even the most well intentioned people have blind spots to their privilege.  For example, it took longer than I would like to admit that growing up Asian, people (particularly law enforcement) didn\\'t treat me like other people of color.  My people were given the benefit of the doubt, something that other people of color deserve but don\\'t get.  \\n Nude pics (given that his ex gave consent) are fine.  The lying about living with her warrants a discussion.  After said discussion is when you should decide if it is a big deal or not.   I get whatchu sayin.  You\\'re right in a technical aspect. I\\'m just a hater and refuse to accept people who don\\'t live between Boyle Heights and the Santa Monica as people who live in Los Angeles.   This all hinges on which planes they used.  Let\\'s assume they all used the best fighter planes they had throughout the war.  In this case, it would be:\\n\\nUS: P-51 Mustang\\nRAF: Supermarine Spitfire\\nLuftwaffe: Bf109\\nSoviets: Yak-1 I guess.  Russian aerial power was not their strong suit.\\n\\nIn the first scenario, the short answer:\\n4. Soviets\\n3. Luftwaffe\\n2. RAF\\n1. USAF\\n\\nThe Soviets were not known for aerial dominance at any point in the war so in a WW2 free for all battle they would be the first to be destroyed. They had a lot of planes but none of the planes were up to the same level as the other three. The Luftwaffe reigned supreme for a long period of time but as the allies ramped up their war efforts, it was clear that their technology couldn\\'t compete.  The real competition is between the USAF and the RAF fighters and I would give the edge to the USAF because of the P-51 Mustang, probably the best plane in WW2.\\n\\nIn the second scenario, it would probably be the same ranking for the same reasons.  The training of the pilots didn\\'t nearly matter as much as the technological advances of the fighter planes.  Forget what everyone says about how we (US/Allies) won the war because we were better and stronger and the American spirit couldn\\'t be beat.  We won the war because of technology and superiority in said technology.  Our planes were better, our bombs were better, our tanks were better, our guns were better, and it didn\\'t matter who used those weapons.   It seems like they are for the wrong reasons.  I never understood how some people, no matter how beautiful they are and no matter how many people tell them they are beautiful, look into a mirror and see all the flaws in themselves.  It\\'s really frightening and sometimes a little tragic.  I hope the best of luck to you and I really don\\'t have any good advice.   I agree but what\\'re you gonna do.  Your gf doesn\\'t love you and loves your friend, you\\'re gonna have to eat it.   It\\'s only been three months.  Just be patient.  Don\\'t worry, no matter how obsessed he is with a children\\'s card game, you are a real life woman.  You literally win EVERY TIME but you just have to take some time.  You might be second but it won\\'t be long.  Trust me.  Again, you\\'re a woman.  He\\'s a guy.  Magic is a children\\'s card game.  You\\'ll be fine.   I\\'m still so fucking pissed that she won HvV.  It\\'s not like she didn\\'t deserve it it\\'s moreso that I can\\'t believe she won it.  OMG.  PRESIDENT ROSLIN!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ummm.  Question... Umm....  Oh, I got one.  How did it feel to boss Edward James Olmos around on BSG? Also, you are awesome.   Well, first make up with him.  Tell him that you feel bad about what you said.  And do anything you can to make him feel better.\\n\\nAlso, next time you get a gift, whether you like it or not, just say you love it.  \\n\\nYou kinda acted like a spoiled brat and you should try to make it up to him.  Some men don\\'t find women funny because said men are fucking idiots.  If you think that women are inherently unfunny because of their womanhood, you are a misogynist and know nothing about comedy.  Calm the F down people.  She\\'s only been gone for like 5 hours... Her phone could have died.  Shiet son, a white girl doesn\\'t call back for a few hours and people already looking for her.   How is Ali possibly this unlikeable? I 100% agree with you. Dude, he actually is on air like 8 hours a day performing his art. It\\'s genuinely impressive and plus, the way he trolls asshat Will Cain is beyond entertaining.  >In the previous Star Treks, gender and race didn\\'t matter and people were judged on their abilities.\\n\\nMy guy, have you ever watched Star Trek ever? This is what makes MMA great and gave us Bisping knocking out Rockhold and then sending a division into a two year anarchic state of chaos. Gotta love it.  Not sure you did the right thing.  Huge moral gray area.  Unless this test was graded on some stupid curve system where her score can affect your score, I don\\'t think you should\\'ve told.  Although, what\\'s done is done, no use feeling too bad about it.  Lack of empathy.  Just because something doesn\\'t happen to you, personally, doesn\\'t mean it never happens to other people.  \\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t take your own child being gay before you realize that gay people should be treated like human beings.\\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t take for you to be discriminated against before you realize discrimination is real.   Well, in my point of view is that this is not your secret to tell.  I know you are uncomfortable with lying but it isn\\'t your right to tell so to speak.   Dude congratz!  I wasn\\'t there for the original post but it sounds like things turned out great!  I couldn\\'t stop smiling the moment you decided to break up with your gf because you didn\\'t want put a mom and her daughter out on the street.  Good for you.  Madison sounds kinda adorable and it seems like you love her very much.  I am sincerely super happy for you and I\\'m glad things turned out well. I\\'m glad you helped out Rachel and Madison in the first place because you are a good person and now you\\'ve been awarded with a great family with more happiness to come soon!  Oooooohh really?  And these \"legitimate issues\" are as important as literally any of the discrimination men commit against women?  Plus I hate fucking kids anyways.  And that is a double entendre  Dafuq they doin mic\\'n up LaMichael James.  He don\\'t do shit but return kicks.   Well, Rob C was outclassed and outmanned by BR early on in the game.  Rob C would have never gotten far.   I don\\'t see answers. Only three questions. hashtag logicked   A nice looking, big, white house from the outside filled with jocks, fast food, and a big orange moron in the gaudy gold-lined interior is the most American thing I can imagine.  Calls your ass an uber, I got somewhere to be.   Go with the GOAT.   Illegal.  If you\\'re on tv, you have to be compensated for it.  Union rules yo.   Hawkeye because legolas is too pretty and too distraught because he got dumped by Miranda Kerr.   Unless you are a JK Rowling or a Stephen King, chances are, as an author, you will be broke.  Most authors barely make enough money to survive on and often need to find side jobs.  If you believe in your talent, I say go for it but be forewarned that it is not a life where you will have constant income and financial stability.   Capitalism. raisins in potato salad.  Everyone in America would have free healthcare.  Those people helped me win a pretty cool amount of money this weekend so bless all y\\'all out here making that +175 line.  Facto. Tweet him for me.  it puts the lotion on its skin This is about as likely as America getting a real third political party. Sounds like a good idea.  Is a good idea.  Too rational and good to actually ever happe.  [I only have one response to Kanye after spending the past decade defending him.](https://media.giphy.com/media/wFk7roIpDeXC0/giphy.gif) By eliminating all Latinos and Blacks in this country? I wouldn\\'t put it past the asshole.   But I am a better person because I read.  Reading is important.  Reading is how people learn.  People are better people simply because they read.  Again, there is an Ann Coulter exemption that applies.   The economy gets better?  Really?  You think that guy knows anything about economic policy? And then we went in and killed 100k of them in Iraq.  Because those 100k people in Iraq were DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE for 911.  \\n[Sarcasm]\\n Government funded healthcare.....\\n\\nFree higher education......\\n\\nOh wait, communism hasn\\'t hit here yet either!  Win.   Too many.   Kindness. To me, a Californian, it symbolizes resistance to progress.  Racist, anti-intellectual resistance to progress.   He\\'s not automatically a prick for being conservative, he\\'s a prick for supporting a group that has time and time proved their disdain for the LGBT community and actively pushed laws that hurt LGBT individuals when he, himself, is part of the LGBT community.   If I\\'m a Californian, I guess I have qualms with both sides.  As you will tell, these are not equal qualms.\\n\\n**THE SOUTH**\\n\\nI don\\'t like the outward racism of the south.  The Confederate flag may stand for something else but what the world and minorities in America see is a symbol of slavery and racism.\\n\\nI am bothered by the fact that they take religious zealotry to another level.\\n\\nI am bothered that they are trying to rename the Civil War into \"The War of Northern Agression\" and changing the term slave trade into the \"Triangular Trade\" and how The Civil War was minimally about slavery.  \\n\\n**THE NORTH**\\n\\nI\\'m bothered about how they won\\'t admit that California is the greatest state in the union.  \\n\\nI also don\\'t like how their former king and queen and queen mother was murdered at a wedding.  \\n\\nI furthermore detest the former bastard son of the current usurper king. Jokes that aren\\'t funny.   Coolidge was amazingly effective at causing the great depression by not imposing any regulations.  \\n\\nHere are the people who think Calvin Coolidge is a great president, Calvin Coolidge\\'s mom, Sarah Palin, and Grover Norquist.   I have the perfect girl to hook you up with.  Her name is Jane.   Can\\'t you let me bask in my ignorance? Just saying, don\\'t do good deeds if your end goal for those deeds to get a thank you.  Good people kinda do good things and not expect something back for it.  Just sayin.  No one loves to talk shit about peyton manning and his choking ways more than me but god I want him to throw td\\'s all up and over the seahawks.   The most important you need to understand is that you will never \"lose\" your parents.  No matter what they say or how angry they can sound, they are your parents and will support your decisions whatever they may be.  Sure they may try to steer you in other directions or they may try to guilt you into making certain decisions but in the end of the day, if they are good parents or even just decent parents, they will support you and love you unconditionally.  \\n\\nHere\\'s another important thing you need to know: Since you have been born, you are the most important thing in your parent\\'s life.  Every moment of sadness, every moment they were discontent with their jobs, every moment they did something they didn\\'t want to do they sucked it up and did it because they love you.  Now, you\\'re becoming your own person but look at it from their point of view.  The love of your parent\\'s life is going out to a scary and dangerous world and for the first time, they can\\'t be with you ever step of the way to protect you and shield you.  They feel helpless so they are trying to hold on for as long as possible.  \\nIf you tell them without any anger or judgment, if you sit them down and simply say, \"I love you both but it\\'s time to start my own life.  It\\'s my turn to live and to go out and do what I love.  It\\'s scary, I know, and I know what sacrifices you have made for me and I love you and I thank you for them but it\\'s time for you to let me do me.\"  \\n\\nRemember, you will never lose your parents.  They love you and even if they may not agree with your position, they will grow to respect it.   awww good guy steve young.  Restores all faith I had lost in him during the whole prop 8 thing.   Round 1: Batman can absolutely take down Superman if given a month prep time to gather as much kryptonite as possible.\\n\\nRound 2: Superman gets one month all he needs to do is to fly super fast and then literally just tackles batman going full speed and it\\'s done, batman dies.  \\n\\nRound 3: Equal prep time, batman wins.  If Batman gets prep time, Batman always wins.   Well here\\'s the thing, vaccinations work in preventing the disease from spreading.  Theoretically (very theoretically) a vaccinated kid shouldn\\'t get the disease from an infected kid (that is unless the virus has mutated quickly enough for the vaccine to be rendered invalid).  So really, they kids at risk are those who are not vaccinated.  Then again, a lot of families can\\'t afford the vaccination so these dumbass parents are actually helping infect poor kids.  Evil x Evil = Evil^2 Talk about problems that aren\\'t problems... Geez, this is not an issue.  If this is the only \"problem\" in your relationship and you are going to break up with her over it, you should be prepared for forever-alone-ness.  This is not an issue that I see at all, you have problems with jealousy.   Rob at 40% is too high.  Amber at 70% is too high.  I would put the both of them at about a 10% chance of returning.  \\n\\nParvati didn\\'t even want to come back for HvV so after that, I\\'m sure she won\\'t come back again.\\n\\nEthan is probably at 30%\\n\\nI don\\'t get how 80% is \"up in the air\" on Aras.  80% means they are pretty much returning for sure.  Your percentages are all way too high. all across the board.  Yul didn\\'t come back for HvV, he won\\'t do it again.  Most of these people should be under 50% because if these numbers were anywhere correct, this would have happened already.   I\\'m going to try to be as nice as possible but it probably won\\'t be very nice.  She started a relationship with you because she loves you, you dumb idiot.  Women who love you aren\\'t there for your money or \"stability\" or for someone to \"take care\" of them.  Those women are called whores.  That mentality that you have will ruin your relationship and I honestly hope it does you dumb idiot.  You go through life thinking women want your money and stability and all you\\'ll find are whores and gold diggers which are really just long term whores.  Most women are in relationships because they genuinely love the other person but if you can\\'t get that through your dumb idiot head, you\\'ll forever think that a woman is with you to \"get something\" from you.  You dumb idiot.   Dude..... you gotta let your man watch porn and look at other naked ladies because believe it or not, he\\'s doing it regardless of what you say.  It\\'s not like he\\'s going to look at a porn and then go out to fuck some other girl. Actually, you\\'re definitely in the wrong right now for violating his privacy.  He\\'s fine, we have pictures and videos that we work ourselves to, it\\'s not a big deal.   It gets people to click on your profile.  I could totally post a picture of me standing next to charlie hunnam and people will click for Jax and then be profoundly disappointed by me.   I\\'m sad to say that your only choice is either to put up with her or cut her and your friend out.  You can\\'t ask your friend to tell his wife to shut up and the easiest way to deal is to just cut out people you don\\'t want in your life.  But do it in spectacular fashion because it will make you feel better/never be able to go back.   Hello person who literally lives across the entire country.  How are you today.  BTW I ate so much offing sushi last night I feel sick.  That\\'s not the issue I really had.  If I was him, I would be kinda angry and disappointed too.  The problem I really had was that he seemingly wanted to make her pay or make her beg for him back which is wrong.  She did nothing wrong.  He put her off for 3 years and she shouldn\\'t have put all of her eggs in his basket because of that.   Probably Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan, or George W. Bush.  Campaigning and \"Presidenting\" are very different.  GWB was a great campaigner but I would lean towards Reagan. He could act his ass off.  Boston Rob.  He never takes anything personally.  He works hahhd and leaves everything in the game.  He isn\\'t the greatest player of all time, even I can admit that but I think he\\'s awesome and has a good view of the game.   Well don\\'t feel guilt at all because YOU WERE ON A BREAK!!  \\n\\nFurthermore, since you guys were officially broken up then you don\\'t need to tell him jack shit.  You were broken up, you had sex with other guys, okay, what did you do that was actually wrong?  I don\\'t see anything wrong at all.  Tell him or not, that\\'s your choice but don\\'t feel obliged to do anything.  He gave up exclusivity to your body when you guys broke up.  When my favorite doesn\\'t win the season, I literally hate the season no matter how entertaining it is (HvV).  When my favorite wins a season, I love that season even though it is awful (Redemption Island).   Look at that play again and you\\'ll see that the receivers are only 10 yards down the field and Carolina\\'s #58 is already bearing down on Kap not to mention the 2 other d-linemen that got through.  Then you look at the coverage, no one is actually open.  I see Bruce Miller on the bottom of the screen and Carolina 41 is gonna be on him, a throw to Miller is a pick six.  Vance McDonald and the other receiver beneath him (on the screen) have the illusion of being open because there is one corner between them but Keuchly (I think) is already heading McDonald\\'s way which would result in a best case scenario knock down, worst case pick.  And then there are the safeties (1 is not in the shot) so it means that the receiver on the top of the screen is virtually doubled up since there since that safety doesn\\'t have anyone else to guard.  \\n\\nThat play was DOS, dead on snap.   Man... what 20 year olds think is a big deal is kinda hilarious.  \\n\\nBreh, people cheat, by the time you get to 30, every person you will know will have been cheated on or have cheated on someone.  It happens.  It doesn\\'t mean it dictates future behavior.  It doesn\\'t mean she will cheat on you.  Shit, you may cheat on her.  \\n\\nPeople who make declarative statements like \"once a cheater always a cheater\" are stupid and think the world is black and white with zero hues of gray.  \\n\\nNeither of you should feel too bad about it.  Past is the past.  Move on breh.  But you\\'re judging the people you are helping.  If the reason you do good deeds to so other people thank you, you\\'re doing good deeds for the wrong reason.  Sure, it\\'s nice if someone thanks you, but you should help people regardless of their thankfulness because your goal should be to help people.   Peer pressure is so real. Dude, DO WHAT YOU THINK MAKES YOU  HAPPY. \\n\\nA guy who spends he entire life just picking up random women to fulfill the emptiness in his life is obviously living the best life and I wish i could be him so badly. He\\'s winning. \\n\\nBut we can\\'t all win like that. If this girl makes you happy and you  want to be with her, DO IT! Life is too short to listen to what other people tell you to do.  Did you choose the name Siri or is that your actual given name?  \\n\\nAlso, has Apple decided whether or not to file a lawsuit? Well.... it\\'s kinda true.  Arizona is definitely a racist desert wasteland.   uhhh dump her.  Your girlfriend.  That is waaaay over controlling and she is expressing a tremendous amount of distrust.  Seriously, she won\\'t let you hang out with anyone alone? Anyone?  I\\'m sorry that is a deal breaker.  I would tell her that if she doesn\\'t trust you, the both of you should end things now because it wont last.   And also dat prettay prettay face. Me is mad at you for not going to class and learning proper grammar.   Fucking peckerwoods.  Swear to god they really ruin everything.  Look, the way I see it, if your friend is dating a white supremacist, there should be something wrong with her too.  You should think about cutting her out of your life entirely.  I know she\\'s your best friend but think about the person who would voluntarily be in a relationship with a racial supremacist.  \\n\\nYou\\'re going to either make a choice.  Accept her and her racist peckerwood boyfriend and potentially be associated with him or you cut both of them out of your lives.  Seriously, racist honkies are the fucking worst.   If we aren\\'t stupid, ICE will no longer exist by the 2028 Olympics.  Check the time stamp G, I hit this way before he did.  It\\'s not like the company sold for 4 billion dollars or something.  Learning and engaging is different from appropriation. Appropriation, in a colloquial sense, is devoid of respect or understanding.  Transgenerational wealth.  Neighborhoods with rich people are safer than neighborhoods with poor people.  White people, which make up much of the ruling class, tend to have more money than most people of color.  Poor white neighborhoods are just as dangerous as poor neighborhoods of people of color.  I watch F1, boxing, MMA, and a tiny bit of Premier League. It\\'s all the same. It\\'s gross.  Step 1) Go to the morgue and get an unidentified cadaver. \\n\\nStep 2) Use a grinder to grind the teeth down to your own dental records.\\n\\nStep 3) Burner phone\\n\\nStep 4) Freedom.  He wanted to begin the conversation by offering what he would\\'ve done.  Why are you being a dick? In many states, you\\'re still allowed to fire people for being LGBT. I like this.   Compromise.  Live together now.  Get the big wedding later.  You want a wedding, he wants a wedding, money doesn\\'t allow for it at the moment so hold off.  If you really want to get married to him, city hall it now and have the big ceremony later when you are at a better financial state.  Meh.  No one really cares.  There are actually very few industries that care about your GPA and I finished college without learning really anything other than how to run a train on tequila shots.   Yeah, that\\'s pretty hard.  Also, people actually don\\'t like it when you call it \"cali\" although I never got the memo.   The problem isn\\'t the number.  Numbers deceive.  Numbers make Tony Romo look like the best quarterback in the world.  It\\'s timeliness.  Kaepernick throws interceptions and while there aren\\'t that many INTs, the issue is when he throws them.  He throws INTs when the team is in scoring position way too much.   Yes it is.  You need to explore and live in college.  You need to find more people and date more people to know which guy you can actually live with forever.  Break up.  College is not a good time for being in a relationship.   Yes. In the end, the only receiver truly open is the WR that is second from the bottom.  Between Miller and McDonald.  You would have to test if Kap can throw a ball 15 yards, over two DEs quicky than a corner (Car 27) can cover 5 yards on the ground.  Even if the ball gets out, the WR would have to make a play to catch that ball and if that WR is kyle williams, that\\'s pretty much a drop.   Well you can\\'t make anyone love you, that\\'s the problem.  You can\\'t stop anyone from loving anyone and you can\\'t make anyone love anyone.  You love your girlfriend, your best friend loves your girlfriend and your girlfriend loves your best friend.  Sorry but you\\'re gonna have to take a seat even though you\\'re in the right.   ......... so the stereotype once again proves true.  Friendzoned in the most classic sense.  What will happen now is that you will hold in your feelings for a really really long time.  You keep waiting for the right moment but that moment never comes.  You wait and wait.  And then one day, she tells you that she met this new guy and thinks he\\'s super cute and that she\\'s gonna go out with him.  Then she starts dating this new guy and you are sitting at home with your dick in your hand waiting for them to break up.  They break up but then you don\\'t want to be a rebound so you don\\'t tell her anything immediately.  You tell yourself to hold off a week.  Only a week and then 5 days after she breaks up with her now ex, she starts seeing another guy.  You support her on this relationship while you go home and once again sit with your dick in your hand.  This process repeats itself until you decide that the two of you would have never been a good couple anyways and then you realize that being around her and her boyfriend at the time makes you unhappy.  You start distancing yourself from her and seeing her less and less.  You text her once in a while asking about how she\\'s doing or saying Happy (whatever holiday it is or Birthday) but that\\'s about.  Soon, you stop talking to her completely and maybe you move out of town for work.  She\\'ll go through a few guys and then finally find the person she marries and has kids with and you\\'ll find someone else but you will get married.  One of you will get divorced, maybe both of you and you or she will hear about it through the grapevine somewhere else and after not thinking about each other for the longest time for a long time you think back to why you never told her how you felt because you were such a pussy and that maybe if you had told her, the two of you might have been happy.  \\n\\nMoral of the story.  You\\'re a puss that\\'s gonna die unsatisfied with your life unless you tell her your feelings immediately.   Totes on your side.   Uhhh...... good luck?  I have no idea how to handle this.  I would say, be respectful and let her initiate things?  That\\'s how I would personally handle something like this.  \\n\\n**Edit** I\\'ve thought this over and I am completely wrong.  What you should do is make like Ray Guy and PUNT!  You cannot waste your youth not having sex, you should be out there fucking everything that lets you.  Seriously, I\\'m not kidding or joking in anyway.  There\\'s a good chance you stay with this girl for years and then never get married.  Think about that.  Really think about that there\\'s a chance you could be a 20 year old single virgin which is nothing to be ashamed of at all.  But there\\'s also a chance you could be a 25 year old single virgin.  How about a 30 year old single virgin?  Your relationship can end at any moment whether its a transgression on your part or her part or if it just isn\\'t working out in whatever circumstances you will experience.  Go out there, don\\'t get tied down to not having sex.  Fuck as much as possible while you\\'re young.   Here\\'s the thing.  If this is a truly good guy, he may stick around because he cares more about your personality and how you are as a person now.  I mean I wouldn\\'t go, \"Hey my name is Sam and I have herpes.\"  However, I would bring it up within the first date.  It\\'s gonna be a hard route but I\\'m sure there are good guys out there that realize that if you are safe, whatever issue you have can be overlooked as long as you are a good person with a good personality and a good heart.  \\n\\nI\\'m sorry for your predicament and it\\'s going to be difficult but sincerely, good luck and I hope you find a guy and find happiness.   Yea, whomever decided to put goat cheese on a burger does not deserve to eat a burger ever again.  Ten months actually isn\\'t that much time. You\\'re not learning anything new during the training camp and much of those ten months was rehab for his injury. You can\\'t make monumental improvements and undo lifelong bad habits.  I hate that I have to be honest here but most girls won\\'t date you for exactly the reason you think.  However, the bitterness is also a factor.  Look, if you lower your standards and go for girls that aren\\'t classically referred to as \"attractive\" and you might find some luck.  But ugly short and bitter is definitely going to be a setback.  I won\\'t lie.   Plus he got a mouth and an attitude and I love it.  Some children are just little shits.  Give your daughter unconditional love and know that she\\'s too young to actually mean the things she says. \\nThe thing about family and unconditional love is that the love is \"unconditional\".  You love them even if they don\\'t love you back which I\\'m positive is not the case.  When I was 3, 4 or 5, I always wanted my mom\\'s sister to be my mom instead of my actual mom because my aunt always bought me stuff and spoiled me.  Now that I\\'m in my twenties, I realized how much that probably hurt my mom\\'s feelings and I feel awful about it even though she said she didn\\'t mind.  That\\'s the problem with being a parent, you can\\'t complain even when you have every right to.\\n\\nLook, i won\\'t lie and pretend I know how it is raising a child.  But coming from a person who has had my issues with my mom in my adolescence and my teens, I realize that she always wanted the best for me and even though I was absolutely awful, she still loved me no matter what and that is really the key to it.  Love your daughter even if she seemingly doesn\\'t love you back and try as hard as you can to brush off any mean comments.  She will grow up and it will get tougher for a while but if your unconditional love might mean that she will grow up to be a well adjusted and happy individual, you have to do it even if you never get love in return.  That\\'s the sacrifice of being a parent and it sounds sucky but sometimes, it pays off.  I didn\\'t realize how much my mother did for me until I was in my late teens and now, years later, I love her more than anything else in this world.   If the Valley is Los Angeles, Oakland is San Francisco.   Don\\'t feel ashamed and don\\'t feel slutty at all.  You are a perfectly normal human being and you should not be ashamed that you had sex earlier than some people.  Guess what?  Some girls have sex earlier than you did and that\\'s fine too.  You don\\'t have any problems and some people are just not entirely comfortable talking with their sex lives and some people are.  You should not feel ashamed for everything you are fine.   I suggest (now there are some moral gray areas here) that you ask this girl out but you have to tell her right away that you are going through preliminary divorce proceedings.  You have to know that you are not going to flip flop on this divorce and lay it out to her.  Something along the lines of this:\\n\\n\"I really like you and I know that my personal life is a little bit of a mess right now.  There is no hope in my marriage and I\\'m filing for divorce and I know you probably wouldn\\'t want to step into that mess but I felt like if I didn\\'t tell you how I felt right now, I may not get the chance in the future. So here it is, I like you.  A lot.  Would you take a chance on the mess that is me?\"\\n\\nShe says yes, end scene, roll credits, que outtakes.   No.  While I believe that you should be giving a woman with kids the same chance, if you do not feel like you are ready for kids or want kids, then you do you, boo.  \\n\\nThe whole percentage thing is sorta nonsense but I get it, it\\'s difficult dating a woman and falling in love knowing that you\\'ll always be #2.  \\n\\nBasically it is not unreasonable for a 28 year old to want to date a women who haven\\'t had kids.  I would urge you not to be dissuaded or averse to women who do have children because you may be missing out on some amazing women that you will otherwise never meet.  At the end, it\\'s still your life.  You do you, boo.   Fuck yes.  That\\'s who Kap is.  He\\'s a great guy and he seems like a nice person and as much as I felt bad for Alex, I fucking love Kap.  He\\'s not the best quarterback in the league, hell, Russell Wilson, at this stage, is better than he is but this guy is amazing.   \"yEa bUt hE nO lOoK gOoD dOe.\" - chuds\\n\\nFuck outta here. DC is a top p4p guy because he goddamn wins goddamn fights. Did you see what he did to Volkan Oezdemir? He cruxifixed a dude who was half a foot taller than him after working him on the feet.  THIS IS WHAT I\\'M SAYING. Marc Goddard didn\\'t hold Alvarez\\'s face in place as Poirier punched him.  Maybe you shouldn\\'t be in a relationship and drag someone into your bullshit before trying to fix your shit on your own. Oh shit, I sound hella grown right now, good job, me.  That\\'s a given.  That\\'s plain evil.  I love it.   No one turns gay.... they\\'re born whichever way they are.   Uhh... no.  In this case, voting with feelings and brains means voting against Trump.  He has suggested literally zero good policies.  He has questioned whether the constitution is constitutional in revoking birthright citizenship.  He has pretty well explained his thoughts about latinos.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know... voting against trump seems to be voting with ya brain tho.  He didn\\'t say it was impossible, he just said thatyou are very sad in believing that.  One punch knockout power is one punch knockout power.  There are replays.  I don\\'t like mcgregor but he tagged him hard and put him down.   Understand that she is still your mother\\'s wife.  You would want to do anything you can do help your own parents no matter who objectively bad they are.  \\n\\nYour wife views her mother and father differently from how you view it.  It\\'s not great that she betrayed your trust but if you understand where she is coming from, you can be more ready to deal with the issue.   When cops stop and frisk innocent minorities? >This isn\\'t even that hard.\\n\\nI SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!!!!\\nI GET IT!!!! \"hard pressed not to do physical damage to you\"\\n\\nJeez, over a cat?  You be trippin.  You needa get help, lonely virgin.   First of all, good title.  Misleading but I still like it.\\n\\nSecondly, let her go.  There are moments to fight for someone and then there are moments to let it go #Frozen. \\n\\nLet\\'s go through your relationship.  She flirts hard with you.  Then tells you she has a boyfriend.  Then cheats on said boyfriend with you.  Says she wants to be with you and breaks up with the boyfriend.  Then after a few calls and texts, all of a sudden, she only kinda wants to be with you and is stuck in a quandry?  It\\'s like, homie, make a pick already dawg. \\n\\nThe girl is 18, you\\'re 18.  She doesn\\'t know what she wants and you probably don\\'t either since YOU ARE BOTH 18!  Biggest mistake you can make is getting into a relationship in college.  Go out and \"hang out\" with as many people as you can.  Bang chicks, get drunk, party hard without the responsibility of a girlfriend.  You have the rest of your life to get in a serious relationship.    Steve Byrne said in his recent AMA that he loves you and really liked Whitney (the show, not just your first name).  Do you like Sullivan & Son?  Also what is your favorite stand-up comedian led show? (i.e. Louie, Inside Amy Schumer, Sullivan & Son, Undateable, etc.) People are so dumb.  Seriously, vaccines save lives but if you choose not to perhaps save your child\\'s life, well, darwinism baby.   I KNOW HIS HELMET ISN\\'T THE SOURCE OF HIS POWER BUT HE ALWAYS CHASES AFTER ANYONE WHO TAKES IT!  FLASH COULD TAKE IT AND THEN LITERALLY ANNOY JUGGERNAUT TO DEATH And the title started off so great.  Girl [23] fucks me.  Why couldn\\'t it end at that??  \\nAll the advice I have for you can be summed up in one line.  Fuck that bitch.  Move on, homegirl doesn\\'t really like you at all to do this shit to you and plus you really don\\'t want a girl who would do that.  Now mind you, she really hasn\\'t done anything wrong but she\\'s not for you.  What she did, while not wrong, wasn\\'t that cool and you mentioned Dwayne Johnson so you\\'re automatically cool... ish.  You should have called him The Rock.   This is by far the worst formatted title/question I have ever seen You, sir, are speaking for the entire male gender right now.  You get a stuffed crust pizza for the stuffed crust, not the pizza.  I wouldn\\'t even know where to start to explain it.   Suck it SoCal Getting bombed on by a Cuban superhero to own the libs.  And they are wrong.  And corporations also aren\\'t people.   Lying by omission is not lying when it doesn\\'t involve you.  This isn\\'t even that fucked up of a problem.  Trust me, problems get way more fucked than this.  WAY MORE FUCKED.  This is some primetime abc drama that can be resolved on it\\'s own.   Oh the plethora of Clive Owens/Gerard Butler (they are the same person) shitty action movies, this one is the least heinous.  Film Critic SVU would not have taken this case. I would see that I\\'ve said about 19 total words on the show so far and know that there\\'s no hope for me.  I would sit back, relax as they vote me off and go to ponderossa and party that shit up.   Easy.  Taylor Swift.  I can\\'t stand her public persona and I can\\'t stand her misrepresentation of feminism and I can\\'t stand her music but I would have absolutely zero problems with sleeping with her.   Regardless of whether or not I think it\\'s a good idea, hate speech and the dissemination of false information will probably be made illegal in 100 years.  I rest my case.  \"good\" person.   Ok brad.  So you\\'re from the south? Won* #grammarnazi Also didn\\'t know that Macklemore used to do 70\\'s porn.

Shamylan Twist: The Bush administration had a fair shit bunch of warnings that a terrorist plan/attack were imminent and essentially did nothing to stop it.

Bruh, we\\'re not even sure that Fury could beat Khabib in mma.  Not be the ruler of the nation.  If we operate under the theory that Covington is really not that good and Woodley won\\'t allow himself to be smushed up against the fence for 25 minutes, it could possibly, maybe, per chance be a pretty entertaining beating.  Bingo They are very useful for visual performance and also the cardiovascular health of old people.  This point needs to be made more often.

Nah fam, there\\'s no guillotine there especially if TJ steps over to his right and gets the side control.  There\\'s no one thing. Over-arching move is to eat better and exercise.  Underneath that it\\'s incremental. Limit alcohol. More vegetables, less refined sugar. Good fats (avocado) vs bad fats (potato chip oil). Cardio mixed with strength training. \\n\\nBasically, if you\\'re looking for one secret thing to do, sorry to tell you there isn\\'t one. However, these incremental changes lead into each other and they get easier as you go. Pick a place to start and begin the change then.  Y\\'all said you didn\\'t want facts\\n\\nS my D from the whole entire back.  From the research that I\\'ve done, there isn\\'t enough evidence to back that notion although I can see why that seems logical.  \\n\\nMost victims of crimes are victims by chance. They had the bad luck of being the person in the wrong place at the wrong time.  \\n\\nThe scenario you\\'ve given happens for sure but if it were the rule instead of the outlier, I imagine that data would be present and more clear.  \\n\\nI would imagine immigrants may be the most likely to call police as the bad (earned) reputation of the cops may not have translated across the world to other countries.  I can comfortably say that most people in China don\\'t really know or care about the divide between police and people of color in American.  \\n\\nTo the end of it all, it\\'s more about income than anything else.  Income dictates where people live.  The poorer the neighborhood, the higher likelihood of crime.  Immigrants tend to not be the most wealthy people in the world so they are forced by circumstance to live in poor neighborhoods.  Poor neighborhoods are usually neighborhoods with high population of people of color due to redlining by banks and lack of transgenerational wealth.  People in those neighborhood who start off committing minor crimes (possession of marijuana) are given heavier sentences than their rich, white counterparts.  They get out of jail and due to their record, they are unable to find a job and turn to selling drugs to be able to sustain living.  They are caught and return to jail etc. etc.\\n\\nBasically what I\\'m saying is that capitalism is a disease and it is a disease we have accepted.  Brains and personality the same thing, B.

UW.  \\n\\nIt is not worth going to an out of state school and get racked with student loans unless you are going to well known private school that will garner you business connections (not a better education, that doesn\\'t even matter)\\n\\nUW is a great school and you will save insane amounts of money.  \\n\\nFurthermore, if you are trying to get to law school, just go to any undergrad, what really matters is what law school you get into.  Save your money for the out of state law school.  \\n\\nAlso, there\\'s no pollution around UCLA. It\\'s only 9000000000% cleaner than UC Berkeley.  \\n\\nTL; DR: If you are planning on going to law school, go to wherever. The law school is where it\\'s important.  If you aren\\'t planning to go to law school, then U.W.  Save money, neither UCLA nor UC Berkeley is worth that price.  Try Dr. Gary Penn.  Apparently, he\\'s one of those therapists who won\\'t bullshit you.  However, if you\\'re not in LA and/or ballin, it may be tough to see him.   By the time I expect this to be true, we will literally have people living on different planets.  I don\\'t think a one world government will be that bad of an idea by then.   California doesn\\'t keep Texas in check.  A world-wide union will have the same checks and balances we do.  Different branches of government will have different powers.  \\n\\nAt some point, when humans become an inter-planetary (multi-planetary?) species, it\\'s plausible and maybe natural that people come together as a full planetary government.  And seriously, it\\'s silly that we are fighting each other.  We have worlds to explore.  An ever-abundant universe out for the taking.   We can still have checks and balances in a one world government... I think you think one world government means king of the world.  It doesn\\'t.  It\\'s simply suggesting that the entire world will move towards something like a global version of the European Union.   The myth is this conspiracy of a shadowy group that is driving all world\\'s governments towards this.  \\n\\nWhat true is that as humans progress through time, a one world government would be a natural line in the progression.  Especially in the event that Humans someday become a multi-planetary race.   Just because it\\'s brutal doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not douchey.

I agree with the title.  While Boston Rob is my favorite player, is an overrated winner.  He has a way of burning bridges and underestimating certain people that gets in his way sometimes.  I don\\'t believe in that percentage sentiment however because every person goes into survivor with a 1/18 chance.

Studies have shown that the old you are when you get married, the more chance you have of a marriage that lasts.  \\n\\n2. For me, I would prefer not to be married until at least 35.  This however, doesn\\'t mean I won\\'t have children until 35.  Also, this is all conjecture, if the woman of my dreams says she will leave me if I won\\'t marry her and she feels that I don\\'t truly show I love her unless I get married to her, well, I\\'ll marry her at 23.

I\\'m your age and I can\\'t imagine if I had to deal with a sibling who was seemingly spiraling out of control.  \\n\\nWhat I do know, however, is that people won\\'t change unless they bottom out.  Until they hit a point in their life where they want to change, you can not do anything to change your sister.  Sadly, you will have to wait until your sister hits the lowest point in your life. My advice is to just be there to support her as she spirals.  Be there for her.  Love her.  And just remember that everything she is doing isn\\'t meant to hurt you even if it does.   She\\'s 18.  Don\\'t give up on her yet.  She seems to be going through a rough time and this may stem from something traumatic that may have happened to her.  You must deal with the root problem and the roop problem of her behavior isn\\'t just because she is lazy, selfish, and irresponsible.  People change drastically for a reason and you must deal with the root reason.   1) In the same vein as Wing Zero beating the RX-78, the Exia would be the Wing Zero.

Our 2nd WR (Kyle Williams up until Manningham came back) would be at best a 3rd option, maybe even on the bench for literally any other team including the Jaguars and Tampa Bay.  Having one good receiver and 3 players that shouldn\\'t even really be in the NFL means you only have to double up one guy and you\\'re done.  Vernon Davis is a tight end, not a core receiver.  He has to block and he\\'s not running routes every play.   She is soooooo using you and that shmuck she\\'s dating.  I\\'m not gonna blame her entirely because if that was a guy, we would all be thinking that he is living the life.  In reality, she is being massively unfair to the both of you.  I say you should break this off, it is unhealthy for you and furthermore, to make sure this doesn\\'t happen in the future, you should also tell her boyfriend about the two of you.  This way, she will be confronted with the devilish fruits of her actions and you will feel like you did the right thing AND, oh AND, she will probably hate you forever and never ask you to be her side piece ever again.   You\\'re scoring an older lady who is probably hot as all hell so... You rock too.  Probably harder than I do.   dude... sex is not that big of a deal...

The distinction between LDS and Utah LDS is that LDS are fairly normal and Utah LDS are kinda on par with Scientologists in levels of wackitude.  Magic underwear.  They believe in magic underwear and I am not making this up.  Seriously, take your kid and run.  Even if this ends up in a court case (by the way, he will win because the Utah LDS churches will help him financially to get the best lawyers), at least you tried to save your child from those severely stupid people.  Mitt Romney is regular Mormon.  Check out exmormon.org to hear about the horror stories.  Seriously.  Get out.  For the sake of you, your family, and your child, leave.  Your fiance\\'s sudden turn isn\\'t abnormal, it is the norm and he would be considered the most \"sane\" one out there.  Leave.  Get out.  Make like Ray Guy and punt.   Neither was Kim Spradling.  Also Yul Kwon, save for that immunity idol, would have gotten destroyed.  Penner\\'s bad play was actually the problem.  What he should have done, instead of voting for nate, was to vote for someone else of the Aitu 4 out with Parv, Chadam (Adam but i call him chad), Nate, and Candice.  \\n I think that makes you a racist? Some people don\\'t put that, it simply says \"Posted from OkCupid app\" or some shit and then I have to figure out which one she is.  Or take the coinflip.   I read from the book of Two Chainz.  All you want for your birthday is a big booty ho.  #FSN fuck someone new I\\'m sorry.  You\\'re just too easy to insult.  Like a really easy target.  Like really easy.  But I\\'m sure a ton of guys have said that about you.   Well I\\'m sorry that some times people are c u next tuesdays like you are.  I can\\'t help it if you are unlovable and can\\'t understand hyperbolic speech that translates into sarcasm.   No, i will use this check, meet the guy, become best friend with the guy*, and then make her dump me*.  Also, I guess this guy used you to get to your mom then because you are obviously damaged and can\\'t take any sort of humor.  I might be an awful person but you are just as awful and also probably fugly.  And this is all coming from an awful and fugly person so i know awful and fugly.  \\n\\nJust because no one loves you doesn\\'t mean this isn\\'t hilarious.   see you get it.  I don\\'t have him on my fantasy team but I have one of his teammates on my team and this teammate is crucial to me winning my Shiva trophy.   Okay, this comment will be long so hold on for a bit.\\n\\nFirstly, just because someone is family, doesn\\'t mean you have to have them in your life.  A shitty mom is shitty people and life is too short to deal with shitty people. That being said, of course it is hard to let go of someone as close as your mother.  The emotional abuse she puts you and your siblings through is frankly unacceptable and her unapologetic behavior definitely warrants you to never contact her again.\\n\\nHowever, I was on the side of cut her out entirely until I read that she has bipolar disorder.  Now, this is a different conversation because she is sick and needs help.  Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not saying welcome her in open arms, she obviously needs help and she is refusing to get any.  As a daughter, and a human being, the only think you can do is offer help.  And as a person with deep seeded personal issues, they do not realize it until they hit rock bottom.  Until your mom reaches her lowest point, she will not seek help which sounds cliche but it is true with most people.  \\n\\nHere is my suggestion, try to get your mother help but do not welcome her back into the family.  Her abusive nature is not healthy for anyone especially you.  Continue to try to get her help and refuse to allow her back in with her family until she does so.  This way, she either hits rock bottom upon realizing that she no longer has a job or her family or anything left in this world and she seeks help or she chooses to seek help in order to get her family back.  \\n\\nThe most important thing to realize that, with bipolar disorder and the subsequent (alleged) drug issue, the person who is abusive emotionally to you and your family may not be your mother but the ill side of her.  Mental disorders and drug addictions are both sicknesses that alter the way people act and live their lives.  Your mother is dealing with all of these issues and without the proper help, she will continue on this downward spiral.  Try to get her help and refuse to allow her to see your siblings as long as she refuses. Remember, she was at one point your mother and maybe with the proper treatment, she may one day become your mother once again.  \\n\\nGood luck and I hope you and your mother find some sort of resolution.   It\\'s already great to stay up late.  There\\'s nothing wrong with being a stripper.  Jeez don\\'t be so judgmental.  Go out with her and give her a chance.  Judge her on her personality and how she is as a human being.   I\\'m not near New Mexico but I do love Southern culture says the boy who has lived in California all his life.......... I don\\'t know you personally but us guys are becoming more and more concentrated on personality nowadays.  Of course if a hot girl asks us out, we don\\'t care how bad her personality could possibly be, we\\'ll say yes.  I think it\\'s really your high standards which aren\\'t bad to have.  Who says you can\\'t have the best?  Don\\'t let anyone tell you that.  I settled before for a girl I didn\\'t really like because she was pretty and she let me have sex with her (she was waaaaay hotter than any girl I could ever get.  I still don\\'t know how I got her).  My advice for you, don\\'t waste time on scrubs and go for what you want.  I\\'m sure at some point some guy is gonna come along and charm you off your feet.  \\nAlso, I\\'m sure your personality can\\'t be that bad.  The fact that you are self aware mitigates most of the problem.  I don\\'t know how exactly your personality is \"ugly\" maybe if you elaborate a little more?  I still doubt its as bad as you make it out to be.  Just hold on and wait.  \\n\\nP.S. your standards aren\\'t that high.  Family oriented, smart, funny, tall, good looking is pretty much every girl\\'s standard.  Some girls just lower those standards sometimes for guys like me.  Score! Yea but GSP isn\\'t gonna be Cain Valesquez purely because of size.  When two people are equally trained, size is the next biggest factor, not technique or speed.   What makes them different from a person is inherently in your argument, they are a collection of people, an organization. \\n\\nThey are different than a person because they are not humans.  They are an idea.  They don\\'t have a physical presence.  Corporations are amoral entities whose only purpose is to generate profits.  They are concepts created artificially and a human that does not make.\\n\\nBut even if they were humans, money is not free speech.  If money is speech, all monetary contracts are speech.  Am I only \"speaking\" to this drug dealer? \\n False. I believe Duane Ludwig has access to the astral plane. He\\'s a giant weirdo that sees things mere mortals don\\'t in his goofy weird way.  But they\\'re literally called the \"unified rules\" /s Yea so let them tell him.  Let\\'s say this is a woman he falls in love with.  Wouldn\\'t you want a good relationship with her?  In that case, just don\\'t tell him.  It\\'s not for you to tell.   Is this actually the most anticipated right in the UFC right now? Cuz my reaction was no but then I thought about it and I\\'m starting to think yes.  Good point, Tim Kennedy probably committed some war crimes too but I was thinking more of Ramzan Kadyrov. Hey, stay in america.  It\\'s awesome here minus a few things.  He won\\'t change.  Let\\'s face it right now.  Love for a man isn\\'t a gradual thing.  And also, love won\\'t stop a man from cheating if the man is a cheater.  As a guy, I can tell you, love is not a thing.  \\n\\nLeave this guy, find someone else.  A hottie Aussie would find no trouble in finding a good man in America.  And since the ring is 400 dollars (not even a months rent), just give it back to him as good will.  Good karma.   high key TJ\\'s wife more fire than Cody\\'s Still never understood all the TJ hate. He\\'s great. Saw him at a starbucks once, seemed like a nice guy. Everyone other than TAM guys who work with him seem to like him. His fighting style is my favorite to watch in all of MMA. If you\\'ve ever tried to replicate what he does at the gym, you\\'ll truly grasp how fucking insanely intricate and complicated his whole game is and how is striking leads to takedowns.  Dropping the D without anyone noticing is my super power. And Conor called black people monkeys so I guess it\\'s even except not really.  Tina and Amy weren\\'t telling rape jokes.... I\\'m not sure if you knew what the jokes were.   It\\'s very helpful.  I\\'m saving OP from time that could be used having fun rather than worrying about a girl with whom he has a limited future with.   Hehehehe  \"thundercunt\" hehehehehehehe I believe it.   Or Colton was being a little bitch who whines and hates it when he doesn\\'t get his way.  I so like his fiance 100x more than racist ass Colton.   Just bear with it for your daughter.  It\\'s better you should be there and just get to know the BF better since he will be spending time with your children.  Vet him and make sure he knows that you are their father and if anything goes wrong on his watch, there will be hell to pay.   While it might seem smart to pick the most skilled fighter, size and weight matters waaaaaaay too much in hand to hand combat.  While GSP can outstrike, lets say, shaq, if Shaq goes for a take down, GSP is donezo.  So obviously you would pick a big dude, the biggest dude possible.  Then probably go for the training.  Someone like Cain Velasquez, the UFC Heavyweight Champion from San Jose would be the guy who wins the entire thing.  Him or maybe a defensive lineman/linebacker from the NFL.  Or maybe the artist formerly known as Ron Artest.  Anyway, the end result is the same, America will probably win although I feel like Brazil and Israel will give America a run for their money Is this your life or Maid in Manhattan?  \\n\\nIt seems totally normal.  19 year old and a 22 year old.  Find out if he really likes you, if there is a possibility for an actual relationship and then decide if you should extricate yourself from the job.  \\n\\nBasically, as of right now, all you\\'ve done is make out a bit but the code of don\\'t shit where you eat still holds.  If you want to date him, make that clear and find a different job.   That\\'s not how taxes work. As a niners fan: Russell Wilson should\\'ve been the MVP.  He was throwing bullets and calm under pressure.   Fat is whack It\\'s sad the younger kids won\\'t get that reference nowadays.  Fucking youth.   Mike Tyson and Ali were both also bigger.   Tyron gets too much shit. No one has had an exciting win over Wonderboy or Maia.  Coming here to stay EPO didn\\'t make Cody spam looping right hands in back to back fights. For example, when she made a statement about Tina and Amy\\'s joke at the Golden Globes and she said, [\"There\\'s a special place in hell for women who don\\'t help other women.\"](http://www.eonline.com/news/394445/taylor-swift-on-tina-fey-and-amy-poehler-there-s-a-special-place-in-hell-wait-what) \\n\\nNow the statement, alone, is perfectly fine, but it was in response to a joke made by Tina and Amy at a public event that she saw as an affront to her personally. \\n\\nOkay, let\\'s say that statement is okay.  She obviously doesn\\'t practice what she preaches then as she has had a public feud with Katy Perry after Perry allegedly stole two dancers from Taylor Swift.  In reality, two dancers decided to leave Swift\\'s tour for Perry\\'s.  \\n\\nBasically, Jill Filipovic can sum it up much better in this [article.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/23/sorry-taylor-swift-being-a-feminist-is-about-more-than-just-supporting-your-girlfriends/) Bro, if you\\'re thinking about getting a divorce, DON\\'T HAVE KIDS.   Glorious Leader The Donald halfway through his Third Term Remember when you had that toy that you didn\\'t really like but then your mom gave it to your sister and you immediately wanted to play with it?  You are that toy.  Those girls are you.  Your sister is your gf.  \\n\\nThis is such a fucked up world I\\'ve built.   I wish I could help but if I did, I would feel as though I am betraying my fellow man.   In Santa Monica, Venice, and Marina Del Rey, a 2 person household needs to be making at least 120k to live comfortably. That\\'s probably the minimum. Marina Del Rey expensive as hell.  I think Chris Kyle was a deeply disturbed man who was asked to kill for his country and then, after he had killed so many people, his country and government and everyone realized that it was all a sham. \\n\\nThat stress had to have taken a significant toll on the man and warped his views.  I disagree with it and I hope it did not affect his job but I don\\'t think that the man is a bad person.\\n\\nI was told this a while back and I find it very significant.  Dying for your country is one thing but asking one to kill for country is an entirely different task.  \\n\\nI think Chris Kyle strongly believed that what he was doing was for the good of his country.  The problem is that our government and our country failed him by lying to him and leading him to become a murderer for a false cause.   I\\'m gonna give a bit of a cop-out because it\\'s not really LA (The valley is NOT Los Angeles) but Magnolia and Lankershim is pretty great.   Uhh.... break it off.  If your guy doesn\\'t give you the courtesy of believing you, he doesn\\'t deserve you in the first place.  Clear and simple.  He\\'s made his choice and you should make yours.   As long as you\\'re not anti-gay, I got nothing wrong with what you\\'re doing.   This is too much punter love.  You can never score a single point with a punt.  A punt is essentially a long distance turnover.  If you ever cross the 50 yard line, a punt is so damn useless.  A great punt is one that lands within the 10 yard lines and the endzone.  A great pass is a touchdown pass.  A great pick is a pick six.  A great kick is a field goal.  Punters are fucking useless.  \\n\\n*Except Pat McAfee.  He can tackle.  But as a punter he is useless.  First of all, I\\'ve watched the destruction of Erik Reichenbach many times.  It was impossible for him not to get played.  I would have gotten played even if I knew the plot.  Their scheme didn\\'t pick on a stupid player, their scheme was perfect.   Yea, I mean, Kap is a hard worker and humble too but with Alex, it\\'s different.  Kap is young and has a chance at greatness.  Alex Smith knows his ceiling and he knows his ceiling isn\\'t that high but he still works hard and isn\\'t discouraged.  It\\'s more that Alex doesn\\'t have delusions of grandeur, he doesn\\'t think he\\'s destined for something greater than he already is.  Again, not saying that Kap is delusional but it\\'s something about being realistic in expectations that I really like about Alex Smith.   I don\\'t follow the rules.  I\\'m a rebel.  I know, it\\'s not an indictment on you really.  I\\'m just pointing out that yes, it is shitty of them not to thank you but that shouldn\\'t be an indicator of your desire to help people in general or that person specifically.  Think about it this way, mothers love their children even when they are unthankful little shits.  You should do the same.  You should help people in need regardless of their reaction to your help.   Well if your man\\'s baby mama \\nis expressin lots of drama\\nYou better tell that bitch to calm her\\nass down \\nor she bouta feel some trauma\\nupside her head crown.   Well since you are asking whether this is real life or if this is just fantasy, are you caught in a landslide with no escape from reality?  You can just open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.  First note, if you are about to get raped or you got raped, it is never the victim\\'s fault.  It is not partially your fault and don\\'t think that way.   How this isn\\'t the top comment confounds me.  As a millennial, can I just say \"Lool, wut is a savings?\"\\n Is it me or does it bother everyone else when non-black people use the word nigger?  I\\'m Asian, I don\\'t really have a dog in this race but I just think it\\'d be better if non-black people would just stop saying it.  I know a lot of black people are okay with it but I mean, I just feel uncomfortable.   I\\'m okay with it.  He believes in magic.  And magic is awesome.   Good. Woodley shouldn\\'t fight Usman if Till misses weight despite whatever UFC or fan pressure.  Hey it\\'ll be okay.  Some guys are little shits who are undeserving of love.  You\\'ll find someone new.   You\\'d be surprised.  I\\'ve heard many people where I live proudly announce that they\\'re too busy to read or they say that reading is boring.  \\n\\nThe lack of a sense of wonderment is deeply troubling.  Please people, just fucking read.  It\\'s not that difficult and can be quite engaging and makes you a better person (unless you are reading Ann Coulter\\'s book, in which case I rather you not read at all).  Toasters.   Basically this.   I smart.  I loyal.  I grateful.  They appreciate that.   No because scholarships geared towards black people were created due to the fact that white people obtain most of the scholarship money in general.  \\n\\nThe same way that a historically black college can\\'t be sued for being historically black.  It\\'s only historically black because other schools wouldn\\'t let qualified black people in.\\n 3 weeks after world-wide premiere of a movie.\\n\\n1 week after air-date on TV. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry that you didn\\'t watch The Wire but I\\'m not going to hamper my discussion because you\\'re 2000 and late.  \\n\\nHowever, if someone specifically and cordially requests that I don\\'t spoil a specific movie before the discussion, I will honor the request.   Facto.  Thank you.   If you\\'re asking for a place that highlights un-signed, un-discovered talent, then I would go to Room 5 for music and The Comedy Store for comedy (even though it\\'s grody and gross and I\\'m almost 100% certain there are no people working the doors).  \\n Because a car\\'s intended purpose for existing is to transport people.  A gun\\'s intended purpose is to shoot and hurt/injure/kill people.   Very outdated.  Original intent was for citizens to fight against a tyrannical government but that intent has now been rendered null.  People can get all of the automatic rifles with extended magazines they want, the government has drones, bombs, tanks, and aircraft carriers. Maps.  Google Maps.  Google flights that you can buy a flight to Moscow.  History books.  Pictures.  Or maybe smack he/she upside the head to try and knock the stupid out of them.  Interstellar.  I thought it was such a strong movie until he fell into a bookcase in a \"Honey I shrunk myself and ruined the movie\" moment.  Hated it.  Just sat in the theater going, fuck this.   What it means to be American to me is anyone who is a resident of this country.  In a more romanticized sense, an American is a person who believes in hope, equality, justice, and an obsessive compulsion to help those in need.  \\n\\nI am aware that this is not what much of the United States stands for nowadays but I am hopeful that it can someday get \"there\".  America is something I believe in and it something my parents believed in.  This is the greatest country in the world if it lived up to it\\'s potential.  We have a lot of work to do to get there but if any country can do it, it\\'s this one.  Facto Exacto.  If he/she is not awfully rude, I\\'ll go 20-25%.  I don\\'t mind things taking a little long, I don\\'t mind a lot.  I minimum out at about 20% and depending on how busy the server is, I\\'ll tip more.   No... nothing turns people gay.  If you\\'re saying that people turn gay, that means something can happen to you tomorrow and then you\\'ll slowly or rapidly just become gay.  That doesn\\'t happen.  No one ever grows to love dick if they didn\\'t love dick before.   Because people are out for their own interests.  \\n\\nIt\\'s a few different reasons.\\n\\nFirstly, a successful business owner doesn\\'t want anything to change the status quo.  The fear of not being rich is much stronger than the hope of getting richer in the future.  \\n\\nSecondly, some business owners wouldn\\'t want that to happen just through the idea that they would have to pay their employees much more thus increasing labor costs on their business.  While this may seem like a clear loss for business owners, if everyone has more disposable income (especially those living in poverty and lower middle class), they spend more of the money and businesses may end up getting more business.  \\n\\nThirdly, some people just don\\'t like democrats and if democrats suggests anything, they will automatically disagree.  This is a very small subsect of people but they are very loud.   Monsanto or Koch Industries.   Good sunglasses.  Quality does matter when it comes to sunglasses and you will immediately be able to tell the difference between 20 dollars and 100 dollars.  \\n\\nEdit: Spelling.  That might be the flimsiest excuse ever.   The Big Bang Theory because it insults our intelligence, women, nerds, fans of comedy, fans of good film making, fans of science, Indians, and for some fucking reason people keep watching that bullshit show.  \\n\\nEdit: realized I covered all women, no need to go through the exact women that Big Bang Theory insults since it is basically all women.   I love this and I approve.   Walk away, bro.  This is a fight you can\\'t win.   Bang her sister/mom.  She\\'ll never get back together with you after that.   Giant gun battle with an entire criminal organization who killed my best friend.  I, a lone gunner, takes out 35 guys including the boss but not before he was able to squeeze off a fatal shot.  \\n\\nAs I\\'m bleeding out, my ex-wife, a detective for the police department, arrives at the scene and I am able to provide some closure for our relationship, I tell her to take care of our daughter and then I die.  End scene.  Fade out.   Right?  Just like, make up some actual word.   Still Bill O\\'Reilly.   Because we, Americans, love to remind everyone else that we are the single greatest nation in the history of nations.\\n\\nNote: This because we actually are amazing.  U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A  Okay. done.  Best answer to any question ever.   Removing the death penalty.\\n\\nThis is not a moral-ethical issue.  I actually support death as a punishment and I support for much less crimes than capital murder.  \\n\\nThe issue I have with it is the inherent flaw with our legal system.  I rather 100 murderers spend their life in prison rather than the chance of 1 innocent person being executed.  Sadly, the reality is that more than 1 out of 100 people are innocent.  A study was done and the results suggest that [4% of all those who are sentenced to death are actually innocent.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/28/death-penalty-study-4-percent-defendants-innocent)  Think about that.  4 out of 100 people we execute didn\\'t commit the crime at all.  \\n\\n\\nI also don\\'t believe that the desired deterrent effect of the death penalty exists.  People who have decided to murder aren\\'t going to stop just because there is a death penalty.\\n\\nThird is the hypocrisy of it all.  You people should not kill so to deter you, we will kill.   So much hookers.  So much blow.   Feminist fought for women\\'s suffrage.  Feminism is all about equality.  It\\'s about empowering the middle class.  It\\'s the same idea as Civil Rights activists but instead of for ethnic Americans, it\\'s for women.   So you\\'re not for equality between men and women?  Because that is all feminism is.  Empowering women to fight for equality.   There was a serious effort to create a negative connotation of the word in the same way that \"liberal\" was made a dirty word.  Many parts of the country see the word \"feminism\" and think that it\\'s about women wanting to be treated as superiors and men should be treated as inferiors.\\n\\nIn reality, feminism is about equality.  Equal rights between men and women but many people, women and men, don\\'t know what feminism means.  All they see is this negative word and they don\\'t want to be attributed to it.  \\n\\nIt\\'s really a fear of the word and a misunderstanding of the concept. The actual argument given by creationists are that these items and fossils are all planted by the devil to deceive mankind.  I\\'m serious.  That\\'s what they actually believe.   1. Bob Dylan - Like a Rolling Stone- Shows the artistry we are capable of.\\n2. Queen - Bohemian Rhapsody - Shows the largess and grandness of our achievements\\n3. Aretha Franklin - Respect - The impressiveness of the human vocals.  \\n4. NWA - Express Yourself - That our artistry has purpose\\n5. John Lennon - Imagine - Within Humans, Hope trumps every other feeling.   Did not know that Reddit is filled with Republicans.  Anyone who makes the assertion that Coolidge is a great president obviously discounts the fact that it was his policies that led towards the great depression.  \\n\\n The right to have children is part of the certain inalienable rights that are core to what we, as a society, believe in.  \\n\\nImposing eugenics or requiring license to have children would be an entirely unjust process in every regard.  Who is anyone to say that another cannot have children?   Why does Christianity shove their views in our face, especially through literally every part of life.   Yes.  Her marriage is over and if she\\'s clear that she\\'s no longer trying to work it out, she\\'s, for all intents and purposes, is a single person.  \\n\\nJust because the marriage isn\\'t over on paper doesn\\'t mean anything.  Her ex could be a dick and hold up the marriage in court for years, it shouldn\\'t restrict her from dating.  \\n\\nEDIT: But do know, you will be dealing with a ton of bullshit.  Divorces are messy.   But so mean.  Why can\\'t you just say \"Everyone is beautiful in their own special way?\"  Just because that special way is that they\\'re ugly doesn\\'t mean you have to burst their bubble.   There\\'s nothing wrong here.  If your boy was cheating on his girl, would you back him up or rat him out to his gf?  If it were my boy, I would back him up because his relationship with his girl is NOT my problem.   I did mention Steve Young.   Make like Ray Guy and punt.  You guys are 17, the odds are against this relationship from lasting forever anyways.  Save both of you some time and let her have a ton of fun in college, you go do you whatever you want to do and if you guys were meant to be, you\\'ll \"be\" later on.  \\n\\nYou should break up now before you guys waste two more years and break up on even worst terms.   I second this motion.  silverlake ramen.  Duh.  \\'nuff said This is what I have to say to you. \\n\\nMake lots of noise.  Kiss lots of boys.  Kiss lots of girls if that\\'s something you\\'re into.  When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight.  Light up a joint, or don\\'t.  Just follow your arrow wherever it points.  \\n\\nSay what you think.  Love who you love because you just get so many trips \\'round the sun.  You only live once.  \\n\\nSo again,\\n\\nMake lots of noise.  Kiss lots of boys.  Kiss lots of girls if that\\'s something you\\'re into.  When the straight and narrow get a little too straight.  Light up a joint, I would, and just follow your arrow wherever it points.   Maybe women don\\'t want to go out with you because of your downer ass attitude.  No one wants to go out with the moping guy standing in the corner of the room. This Is Spartaaaaaaaa!!!! Well, I dunno.  I\\'m sorta working in music in LA and we find a lot of successful musicians in LA playing original music.   Well someone is bitter.  Tons of musicians find success in LA, trust me.  You just need to make sure you\\'re doing it in a smart way and not playing and praying for a miracle.   Awwww, look at all those virgins.  I read from the verse of Yeezus when I say, \"Now I ain\\'t saying you\\'re a gold digger you got needs,\\nYou don\\'t want your dude to smoke but he can\\'t buy weed,\\nYou got out to eat and he can\\'t pay you all can\\'t leave,\\nThere\\'s dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves\\nBut why you all washing, watch him.\\nHe gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun.\\nHe got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes.\\nThis week he mopping floors, next week it\\'s the friers.\\nSo, stick by his side,\\nI know this dude\\'s balling but yeah that\\'s nice.\\nAnd they gone keep calling and trying\\nBut you stay right girl\\nBut when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl\" I was sitting in the stands during the Kyle William drop.  I remember the silence of candlestick that day.  That is seared in my memory.\\n\\nWith that said, people drop punts all the time.  What great quarterbacks don\\'t do is end the final three possessions of the game with Fumble, INT, and INT.  I\\'m sorry, you are not a good qb at that point, you are just an ordinary human being.  Even I can lose a fumble and throw two INTs in a game.  Easily.   In some way yes and in a lot of ways no.\\n\\nNo because she didn\\'t really do much in HvV other than burn russell\\'s hat.  She wasn\\'t particularly evil or strategic, she just stuck with Parv and Russell who did the dirty work.\\n\\nYes because doing nothing is a valid strategy.  Granted it may be a weak strategy, homegirl won it twice and that deserves a lot of credit.  No matter how hard Parv played it in HvV, she didn\\'t win.  So her strategy of being the least offensive of the top 3 is a valid strategy and it worked out for her on HvV and she has the ability to win twice.  Plus, golden rule of survivor, there\\'s no such thing as luckily winning all of survivor.  She had luck and her skill on her side.\\n\\n You have to be comfortable with yourself. If you come to accept yourself and to love yourself, you won\\'t mind being with yourself for long periods of time.  It sounds vague but it\\'s the only advice that I have.   She\\'s friendzoning you.  Don\\'t fall for it.   Yes but not very likely.  It\\'s hard to land a job or representation from a spec script alone in general, regardless of the show.  You need more than just a spec script, you need a body of work.   Wow.... well, you\\'re not overreacting about the donut, but you are overreacting about her actions.  I don\\'t think she understands how much it means to you even after you explained it to her because, in her mind, at the end of the day, it\\'s just a donut.  However, people hold sentimental value in different things so I completely understand what that donut means to you.  I would say that explain it to her and how you\\'re feeling but also explain to her that it might sound stupid but it means a lot to you.  She\\'ll understand.  Hopefully.   Put up with her for the sake of your son.  Remember everything you are going through, it\\'s for him.  Go to court, fight it do everything you can to keep seeing him because he is your son and you should love him.   Batman.  At least he won\\'t kill me.   Shit goddamn, Bill was a good looking fucker wasn\\'t he?  Totally understand why any woman would totally do him in an instance.   Because our stupid culture places a double standard on women and shame them for having sex while us guys can have as much sex as we want without being judged.  She may think you will value her much less if you know she\\'s had sex with a guy.   Four Barrel Coffee gets kinda loud but it\\'s great coffee, got power and wifi and is really great.   Question 1: Are you bigger than the boyfriend?\\n\\nQuestion 2: Are you stronger than the boyfriend?\\n\\nIf you answer \"No\" to any of those questions, back off the girl.\\n\\nIf you answer \"Yes\" to both questions, back the fuck off the girl.  She has a boyfriend.  What is the matter with you? Double standards exist.  A lot of guys wish they had the same situation, a relationship with a girl and then a loyal side piece.  However, to these guys, when a girl does it, all of a sudden she is a slut to the N^th degree.  I\\'m just stating that even when not applying the double standard, she is just getting what she wants, she is no more wrong or right than anyone else in her place.   #winning It seems that no matter what happens, Ash\\'s specific Pikachu is like the strongest thing in the goddam world.  I don\\'t think Agumon, in any digivolved form would ever match up against Ash\\'s Pikachu.  Any other pikachu, Agumon might crush but Ash\\'s it\\'s not even close.   One world was boring and so was Redemption island but if you wanna watch a player dominate the game, Kim and Boston Rob do it like no other can in those two seasons.  That\\'s the only reason I put those above Caramoan (fucking.  boring.) and Nicaragua (I literally hit the skip button on the DVR about 300 times.  Per episode.)\\n   yea homeboy OP is either angry or stupid or both.  Kap has a lot to fix in his read progressions and sometimes, his drop back footwork isn\\'t great however when you\\'re number 2 WR is kyle williams, why even have a read progression.  You can throw it to a wide open williams and he\\'ll drop it.   Uhhhh..... I really don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.  \\n\\nEverything you\\'ve said about leadership is assumptions.  If you are judging a player based on how they are in interviews, you must assume someone like Lester Hayes must be the dumbest cornerback in NFL history.  Or you would assume that Patrick Willis (not a great speaker) would be a horrible leader.  Assuming he smokes weed because of how he speaks is literally the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  \\n\\nKaepernick is in his 2nd year as a starter.  He has read progression problems for sure.  Doesn\\'t help how he has about zero receivers.  Think about what you are saying, what makes a \"championship qb\".  Guess who is a \"championship qb\"  Oh wait, Joe Flacco.  Eli Manning.  Ben Roethlisberger.  All of which sound like giant oafs.  You know who else sounds like a total moron when they talk?  Andrew Luck.  For some reason you are just assuming that he is not a franchise qb after about 18 starts.  I think there are some of your racialist tendencies towards him because you\\'re just assuming he\\'s a pothead and he\\'s not a franchise qb, I don\\'t know but this seems to be coming from an unknown place.\\n\\nMaybe you don\\'t know that he comes to practice earlier than anyone else on the team including Frank Gore and Patrick Willis.  Maybe you\\'re just a hater.  I\\'m not saying he\\'s gonna be the greatest quarterback ever.  I know he won\\'t be a scrub.  He has the work ethic and his shortcomings are those that can be fixed.  Read progressions and otherwise.  You are stupid and also delusional and make zero sense with no actual evidence.  No one knows if Kaepernick will be the greatest quarterback ever but he\\'s definitely a \"championship qb\".  \\n\\n\\n Thanks for the sportsmanship. Cam Newton is looking okay, going through his progression well.  Injuries are killing us and we are in the same position as you guys are, hoping for a wild card at this point.  Kap has a lot of progression problems.  He doesn\\'t really go from 1 to 4 back to 1 in receivers.  He takes 1 maybe 2 reads most times and then rolls out of the pocket, throws it away or takes it and run.  This can be developed though, it is not a glaring issue.  He can get better.   I don\\'t get how you get 7 upvotes while I said literally the exact same thing but I get 5 downvotes.  What the fuck is wrong with you people?  Also, why am I such a point whore? yes.  One team is wild card (hawks) and one team is divisional champion (niners) all because of schedule.  Greenbay was the deciding game.  Golden rule is 6 months breh.  Past that point, if you still haven\\'t watched it, your lost How in the fux did Penner get so far up.  He\\'s NOT that good.   I like the attitude.  Good luck.  Tell your parents that this is the Western World.  (America??)  In this country you are free to love whomever you love and that the difference in religion only exemplifies what this country stands for.  Breaking up an otherwise okay relationship just because of religion makes no sense to me at all.  Race, religion, whatever your creed, there should be no reason that these things are above love.  You family will need to change their thoughts and live with your choices.  They will need to evolve their mindset and they will because you can\\'t spell evolve without Love.   \\n\\nGo get her.  This is not leaving the girl you love and this is not worth giving up forever.  Imagine you having to live throughout your life regretting letting this girl go just because your family didn\\'t like her religion, not her, but her religion.  While sure, maybe this girl wasn\\'t going to be your forever anyways, but are you willing to risk losing the girl you love, potentially your one love (very unlikely but hey, anything is possible), just because of a silly reason like a difference in beliefs from family members?   1) There are a few places that you can live in where the school system isn\\'t really too bad.  It really just depends on where you are working because the Bay area is a huge place.  If you don\\'t mind the commute, I would say Berkeley area isn\\'t horrible for kids and  you wouldn\\'t really need a car there.  Living in San Francisco isn\\'t bad either but the schools aren\\'t the best.  \\n\\n2) Depends on where you live and how close you are to your work but the short answer is, \"Yes you need a car.  Actually, you need two cars.\"\\n\\n3)Uhhh, it\\'s not the area that matters, it\\'s the distance.  I mean to an extent, yes the area matters.  If you are living in deep east oakland, I wouldn\\'t come visit you if you were Jennifer Aniston.   It\\'s really the distance, if you live an hour away, co-workers won\\'t come to visit you because you live an hour away.  \\n ALRIGHT BY DEFINITION WOULD MEAN YOU AREN\\'T POOR!!!!!!!!!  For fucks sake.  \\n\\nadjective\\nadjective: alright\\n\\n    1.\\n    satisfactory but not especially good; acceptable.\\n\\nIf poor is acceptable to you, you need to rethink your entire life choices.  Even with Tyrion Lannister, it is different for everyone.  I like him because of his good intentions and overall a good heart.  Other\\'s like him because he is snarky and doesn\\'t bow down to his father.   For someone who went to stanford and is a super well spoken guy, his typing is prettaaaaaaay awful.   I\\'m an attention whore who seeks approval because my parents didn\\'t love me enough.  or to brag.  one or the other.   As long as you guys had some mad ass post-fight sex then everything is alright.  Otherwise you guys got some serious issues to fix.  I really wanted to go to the Second City improv school but I had to cross chicago out of cities I will move to because of the cost.   What the hell is the \"Central Coast\"?????? If this girls plays both LoL and WoW you might get some sex but you sure ain\\'t gonna enjoy it.  I really enjoy the way Australians say Melbourne.  Like Melbin.   I don\\'t think this warrants an immediate break up but it is slightly alarming.  I think what he did was definitely wrong.  Don\\'t feel as though you have to forgive him just because you have to find somewhere to sleep, he should let you stay just because he\\'s should be a decent human being.  \\nIf this is the only real issue in your relationship, then yes, your relationship is worth saving.  It is worth saving but you have to work out the fact that you don\\'t want him telling the other girl all of your personal secrets.  Otherwise, you\\'ll be fine.   I say you should confront her and be as aggressive as possible.  You, of course, have little leverage over Jill so this will be tough.  Basically tell Jill that you want her off your back and stop being such a rat and get a life of her own.  Tell her that you don\\'t want to be her friend and that you aren\\'t friends now because Jill is just your mother\\'s watchdog.  \\n\\nAlthough, if you want to avoid confrontation, just never go back to your dormroom.  Tell Jill that you are at the library or the coffeehouse reading when you\\'re out.  It\\'s not like she can follow you everywhere you go.  Make up shit about clubs etc. if you really want to avoid the confrontation.   God I wish real life were tv or movies because in that case I would say fly over there because you don\\'t realize you already love him.  \\n\\nBuuuuuuut, this is real life and real life isn\\'t tv or movies.  Best bet, don\\'t make the trip to America to see him.  I guess you can keep talking to him but it would be wise to stop that too because you may be leading him on.  If you love your boyfriend make him the priority and think how he would feel.  Don\\'t make the trip according to X and really reconsider the friendship. Girl, all you need to worry about in this world is yourself and your happiness first.  I say, seriously, just stop contacting him.  This way you won\\'t be a constant reminder of sadness to him and he won\\'t be a constant guilt trip for you.  Be happy with the new guy, if he is awesome you should not worry about it.   So, from what I read, you are Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryan.  \\nIn seriousness though, if the attraction isn\\'t there, it isn\\'t there.  You cannot feel guilty about making yourself happy.  You are trying to be happy at his expense, he has to take time and work through his own issues. \\nAgain, you have done nothing, zilch, nada, not a thing wrong and don\\'t feel guilty about it.  However, what could help is to tell your best friend that you and he can never be a thing.  As a male, I think he may think that there is still hope and that it is an inevitability that you end up together so the fact that you are dating another means you are actively not dating him.  In reality, you are not attracted to him and don\\'t think of him as a potential mate and you have to tell him that it will never happen.  Even if that means losing him as a friend, you have to nip it in the bud for his own good and your own good.    How you do this without Lance on the lakers. You gotta do Lebron, Lance, KCP. Lakers goon squad.  This is essentially the most correct take. You\\'re most likely not getting that money back. You\\'re better off sending goons at him than taking legal action for $700.  What\\'s the opposite of Christopher Walken? They totally are but with an arm in and at that angle, it\\'d be difficult to get an air choke locked.  Gotcha, misinterpreted the original post, my bad. You were talking about how boxing is just one dimension of fighting.  I mean... sources below for domestically:\\nhttps://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2018/the-nbas-growing-popularity-scores-wins-for-sponsors.html\\n\\nInternationally, for what it\\'s worth, the NBA is the most popular sports league in a country of over a billion people: \\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/20/the-nba-is-chinas-most-popular-sports-league-heres-how-it-happened.html\\n\\nPlus, they essentially run the footwear game. I mean when was the last time you see anyone rock the Tom Brady 16\\'s?\\n Basketball, particularly the NBA, has been the most popular it\\'s been in the last decades and continues to hold a ton of influence on American culture as well as culture internationally.  Love TJ but you are 100% right. Aldo is p4p goat under 155lb.  She got you triggered so she\\'s definitely doing something right.  I WANT WAR Oh i\\'m glad because I would\\'ve pounced and then be sweating until my next paycheck.  I\\'m thinking that dollar should go to someone else. A lot of people don\\'t understand how the unemployment rate percentage is calculated. It doesn\\'t count under-employed and those no longer looking for a job or those who are unable to look for a job. 3.9% unemployment doesn\\'t mean only 3.9% of working age people are out of work.  \\n\\nAnyway, society has gone to this point because we like demonizing the poor and think that everything they lack is their fault. He probably thinks that you are too picky or choosy with your job but as a person who moved to LA right out of college with no real prospects of a job, it\\'s fucking hard to get hired doing anything, even bagging groceries here.  \\n\\nNow to your specific issue, I would suggest maintaining the phone service.  It\\'s 180 for the year, you need it to get work. Look for small gigs for cash here and there if possible. Most of it is manual labor and doesn\\'t work for your resume but if you can find it, it\\'s quick and it\\'s cash.  \\n\\nTaking the bus suuuuuuuuuuuuucks but not impossible.  Good luck, it\\'s hard out here.  This tour looks fascinating. Love exploring the more human side of cities. As tourist, we often forget that real people live in the places we travel to, this seems like a tour worth taking.  Damn... sucks for Wuliji cuz Chito Vera is a killer.  Boy, what you know about China? Capitalism works! I think wifebeater might be a problematic term now so lets just call it a guinea tee Souk my D from the posterior.  I\\'m Chinese.  SMDFTB.  throw up.  vegan mac n cheese.......\\n Jaws pulls him 10 feet underwater and Kong dies in 10 minutes.   If you can disown a child, you can disown a brother.   We\\'re talking danger, not crime.  Crime being higher in poor neighborhoods of predominantly people of color have other mitigating factors including but not limited to disproportionate targeting by police and types of neighborhoods (rural vs urban).  Deeply ashamed and hoping/pushing for changes in the future.  Winner.  Hey i get it.  We all go through struggle no matter how well off we are but it\\'s hard for people to see through that some times.  Imagine growing up without food security, coming home from school not knowing whether or not you\\'ll be able to have dinner at night.  When you have that kind of struggle, it\\'s hard to feel compassion for others. It\\'s not right but it\\'s not 100% wrong either.  \\n\\nI believe in your story, absolutely.  It\\'s not that others have had it worse and therefor, your story is invalid.  That\\'s not it at all! People don\\'t know your story and more importantly, they don\\'t want to know.  People don\\'t change their minds.  It\\'s not how human nature works, sadly.  \\n\\nBasically put, not much you can do than to surround yourself with people who care about you.  If people end up hating you due to your background which is not under your control at all, that happens.  Sometimes that happens due to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, sometimes it happens because certain people just hate people with brown hair.  Only thing you can control is how it affects you.   Depending on who the democrats run, low but much better than people think. Some people don\\'t know how to run campaigns and enlists the help of hacks like Peter Douche.   Facts.  Nobu nobu nobu nobu.  school shootings.  Breh, I was talking about Tim The Toolman Taylor, you chud.  Nickelback.  Any Nickelback song is the worst song to play at any occasion.  But.. but... the UFC isn\\'t the problem.... NSAC suspended and fined him.... There\\'s this guy who has led a team to the Super Bowl that is actually probably better than Jimmy G, definitely better than Winston, and totally ready to play.  They hate him cuz they anus. I mean. Ain\\'t him. Whatever.  Dude... it was 5 years ago.  \\n\\nThe question is whether or not they are still dating.  If they aren\\'t, well homegirl needs to get over it.  You slept with her boyfriend at 16.  16! There\\'s no such thing as a serious relationship at 16.  They might think they\\'re in love but pretty much every relationship that starts at 16 will inevitably end in malcontent.  Your friend needs to get over it.  NBD.  It happened 5 years ago.  Her boyfriend committed just as big of a wrong.   WOoooooooow.  3/4 years is forever now?  Damn, I\\'m 22 and even I know a 3/4 year relationship is nothing.  Shit happens and relationships break.  You\\'re 21, you have a lot more years of heartbreak before you even come close to finding the one girl who will love you.  Seriously, you got cheated on twice by two different girls.  Shit sucks.  Sorry but that\\'s life.  You\\'re just going to have to deal with it.   I have a lot of criticisms on Kap but it\\'s not entirely his fault.  His read progression is slow when compared to someone like Brady or Brees but that he can improve on.  A lot of the criticism on him are, however, truly unrequited.  People are down on him because he has zero receiving help.  He has receivers that would drop wide open tosses.  The Carolina game is especially evident.  Once Vernon was out of the game, the only choice the Niners had was run or Boldin.  They put safety help over the top on Boldin and then pack the box with 7 guys, the run is stuffed.  What else can you do?  You have good cornerbacks on the Panthers playing close to the rather slow Kyle Williams who has zero route discipline and hands made of stone and a Mario Manningham that seemed to have some post injury jitters.  What do you do?  The only options you have left are to screen to gore, screen to lamichael james, screen to boldin.  If you are screening, Luke Kuechly is too good to fall for the rush so he shuts it down.  Offensively speaking, we may have the worst set of receivers in the entire NFC.  At least Tampa has Vincent Jackson.   Couldn\\'t agree more.  HIV can only be transferred through specific bodily fluids.  One fluid that doesn\\'t transfer HIV is saliva.  So unless you are trading needles or, even worse, having sex with your aunt, you don\\'t need to worry.   Not a competition.  Jaeger would dominate this.  it\\'s kinda like if a poodle fought a t-rex.  \\n\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ViPceht.jpg Rob and Amber.  They got married and have a litter of kids.  If that isn\\'t the best alliance I don\\'t know what is.  \\n\\nI also liked JT and Stephen, they were good too.   Don\\'t think Forgot About Dre is even close tbh. \\n\\n99 Problems, Hypnotize, Scenario, Hate It or Love It, Lose Yourself, Hail Mary, X Gon Give It To Ya, PIMP, etc. etc. \\n\\nHonestly, I think people just do an impersonation of Eminem\\'s voice and then mumble cuz there\\'s a shit ton of words and ain\\'t nobody got time for dat.

Every last bit of it.   uhhhhh.... the fact that your husband isn\\'t comfortable with telling his co-workers that the two of you are married is mad alarming dawg.  I would really confront him about the whole thing because \"he doesn\\'t want to draw attention to himself\" is a weaksauce explanation yo.  Woah be careful there, they\\'ll stick you with a shit ton of downvotes for speaking the truth.   \"Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my  mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time thinking about death.\"\\n\\nJohn Green, *The Fault in Our Stars* He just fought for an organization that took half of a fighter\\'s pay because the fight wasn\\'t deemed entertaining enough...

That UFC Countdown writes itself.  It\\'s not getting as many viewers because TV rating has been down in general.  Last week\\'s most watched show was NCIS at 18.4 (roughly) million viewers.  10 years ago, a show that gets 18.4 million viewers is considered a slightly above average show, not great.  Hell, American Idol was averaging 25 million in \\'05.  There\\'s less people watching Survivor because there\\'s less people watching TV.\\n\\nSurvivor has also lost a lot of their fan base because there has been 27 seasons.  Casual fans get bored quickly and that many seasons are just too much to keep up with not to mention that there are a lot of very bad seasons within those.  \\n\\nThink about it like this.  10 years ago, everyone knew who Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe were.  Nowadays, what show do you think people can name 6 main characters from?  Probably not.   No?  If i were a guy, I probably wouldn\\'t want to know.

I used it for effectiveness in the quote in order to be snarky but I realize that including this lengthy explanation of my choice to use that word is proving to undermine my intended effects of the quote in the first place.) I really wouldn\\'t be too worried.  We had 3 consecutive games against playoff teams.  It\\'s not like we lost to Jacksonville and Oakland Uhhh, hold the phone.  This girl did nothing wrong.  Never did you guys explicitly say you were exclusive so she\\'s dating other people.  Hell after turning her down for 3 years, she really can\\'t expect much out of a couple of dates.  So yea she goes out with some other guy and she slept with another guy.  There\\'s nothing wrong with that at all.  I actually think you, OP, are in the wrong for thinking that you have to make her pay or \"haze\" her and make her earn your affection.  She may be the 23 year old girl but you sir, are acting much more immature.  \\nSorry, gotta tell it like i tell it.   uhh.... first of all your teacher needs to fix their handwriting. Secondly, this is totally not okay conduct from a teacher.  Birth of a Nation - Based off a novel called The Clansmen.  Portrays the KKK as a heroic force.  Hella blackface is the least racist thing about it.  \\n\\nPassion of the Christ - Depicts Jewish people as evil monsters who murdered Jesus.  Forgets Jesus was also Jewish. If she doesn\\'t read.  \"I don\\'t have time to read\" is not an excuse.  I\\'m sorry, I have high standards, I guess.  As a person of Chinese descent, I can assure you that much of the Chinese population remembers Mao Ze Dong very incorrectly.  He is treated like a god and not the murderous psychopath that he was. \\n\\nAlso, Ronald Reagan.  Homeboy is this conservative hero but he rose taxes more times than anyone.  Plus he also actually negotiated with terrorists.   The TV Show Happy Endings that was criminally cancelled after 3 stellar seasons.   You can\\'t yell fire in a crowded room.  You can\\'t commit slander or libel.  People shouldn\\'t have the ability to get fully automatic rifles or have the ability to get guns without extensive background checks.   I think that\\'s just the people you surround yourself with.  I live in Los Angeles and the people I meet and know are usually pretty smart and hard working contributing members of society.   I echo the same sentiment.  California is a bubble for sure but I\\'m not sure it\\'s a Barry Sanders bubble.  It seems like everywhere across the country, there are large swaths of Sanders supporters everywhere and in all random places.  \\n\\nHillary has a lot of supporters but none of them are enthused by the prospect of her winning.  She is the least worst choice while people view Sanders as the best choice.   The party that brings up racism is the racist one.  Great policy, guy.  I\\'m sure the abolitionists were the racist ones.  MLK? Total racist.   Literally most things.  Outside of child murder, I\\'d let most things go and report it to the authorities later.   First things first, I create a dope play list.  Now you can do podcasts but I usually do a bit of both.  I\\'ll have The Dopeness Mix 2015 and also a couple of banked podcasts on deck.  Singing along really helps the time go.\\n\\nSecondly, if you have someone with you, conversation is always great.  I\\'m one of those people can go on and on and talk forever which is mostly a curse but in this instance, it is a gift.  For me.  Definitely a curse for whoever else is in the car.  \\n\\nLastly, land speed record.  I may or may not break the speed limit to test the top speed of my car.  Of course, this is illegal and I cannot condone it even though I may or may not have rolled down the 5 at 155 in a 20 year old BMW once.  Or twice.  Or every time I\\'m driving the 5.  Allegedly.   Um.... no they don\\'t.  They really don\\'t.  No dude ever wakes up one day and wants dick when they\\'ve never wanted dick before. Like I have my shit together.   I can say, as a straight person, that it has not impacted my life at all.  The world has not ended.  Satan has not been raining hellfire on me.  I have not suddenly found the urge to gay marry.  My unborn children have not suddenly been stowed away by gay banditos.   It\\'s The The Angels Angels of Anaheim.   Because we took the fastest speed we knew of (the speed of light) and measured how far it would reach in a time unit we are familiar with (a year).

It\\'s slightly more simple than the schemes necessary to be a h-back or any other offensive position.  Plus, since Bruce Miller is going through a lot of shit, we\\'ll need someone to fill in that hole.\\n Women are not allowed to hit men.  Grown up people just don\\'t act like women abusing men is as big of an issue as men abusing women.  Because it\\'s not.  At all.   Darker skin, in the past, suggested a lower class.  The darker you are, the longer you are outside in the sun, presumably for work.  The lighter you are, the less you are outside in the sun and presumed that your occupation (and therefore your class) is upper class.\\n\\nThis line of thought has translated through the years and in a subconscious way, permeate through many traditions.  But it seems to all lead back to money.  All appearance based treatment seems to be based to money and class.\\n\\nEx. In medieval times, heavier people were considered more attracted due to the perception of wealth.  Nowadays, skinny people are more wealthy (because they can afford the best food, trainers, surgeries, etc.) and skinny is now in.

You are gonna feel soooooo bad when this ends up in murder-suicide.   I\\'m pretty sure not giving a shit what parents think is the definition of being 18.  Also, if you\\'re parents are gonna be racist, let them be racist.  Doesn\\'t mean you have to be racist too.  \\n\\nHere\\'s the basic deal: If your parents disown you or love you less because you date someone of a different race, those are what we call bad parents.   Shows how much punters matter.   I\\'m on pretty much the same boat as you right now.  It is ridiculously hard to find a place right now.  Try padmapper but I\\'ve been running into a brick wall.   Pick the one with the better personality and not the one with the better looks.  I\\'ve been in this situation (and I was just as amazed about it as you are) and I chose the hot girl with a personality that didn\\'t click as well.   Well, if kap had receivers during the beginning of the season that did more than drop passes he would have been golden.   Ultimatum his ass.  Look, I hate it when jealous girls or guys complain about their SO\\'s having best friends of the opposite sex but your case is entirely different.  Here\\'s what I think, and just a reminder, I\\'m pulling all of this out of my ass.  He has always been attracted to his friend.  He wants to date his friend.  Your boyfriend truly loves one person in this world and it\\'s not you, it\\'s his friend and he keeps telling himself he doesn\\'t love her and proceeds to date other people.  He hates every boyfriend his friend has had and always thinks that he would treat her better if she just gave him the time of day.  \\n\\nHere\\'s a basic way to simplify it.  You are Julie.  Your boyfriend is Ross.  His \"best friend\" is Rachel.  His best friend\\'s boyfriend is Paolo.  Those fo you who don\\'t get that reference, shame on you.   Yea well get ready to hit these feelings about 800 more times before you even get close to finding the actual girl you love and who loves you.  You\\'re gonna have a lot of break ups we all have to do it.   I think one of my ex\\'s feel this way about me.  I am a non-attractive, doughy, asian guy who is at best a 4 and she was a skinny, tall, blonde with huge cans.  I don\\'t know why she let me climb all over her but hey, I had a great time.   What I\\'ve figured out is that life is too short to be unhappy.  Relationships are a lot of work but you know when one works and when one has a definite expiration date.  You have been with a guy for 2.5 years and if you are still reconsidering the relationship, this may not be the relationship that\\'s gonna last.   Well, if you have the receipt you return and cash out.  Otherwise, go to a pawn shop.  Screw that guy, no matter what the jewelry is just sell it.  Teaches a scumbag that that\\'s what scumbags get.  This is funny because every high schooler thinks they are more mature for their age when in reality all high schoolers are immature little shits.  (me included when I as in high school).   What went wrong is that you are both super young and shit happens.  People break up, that\\'s the fact of life.  Most young people break up too.  Shit happens.   While you shouldn\\'t be bothered that your gf is going to a strip show, it is not unreasonable that you are not comfortable with it.  If you trust her, it shouldn\\'t bother you but to each their own.  I say you just tell her that you aren\\'t comfortable with it and you would like it if you she didn\\'t go.  However make it clear that at the end, whatever her choice is, you will respect it and live with that without holding it against it.   There has to be a reason you said no.  I hate to say this but you might have to trust your gut at that moment when you said no.  These reasons you don\\'t know consciously maybe you know them at a subconscious level.  \\nMaybe somewhere deep inside you are in love with the idea of her more than you are with her.  You\\'ve been in love with this girl for 9 years and you\\'ve cultivated this image of her that may not be grounded entirely of reality.  There may be a part of you that feels, through your fwb phase, that she isn\\'t really this girl you have put up on a pedestal.  You might subconsciously feel that if you date this girl, you will have effectively ruined that fantasy that you have had of her.  If you date her, you are afraid that she will not live up to what you have believed in your heart for 9 years.  \\nIn saying all of this, you may have to let her go.  You may have an expectation of what your relationship with her will be and it may be impossible for her to live up to it.  I always hate telling someone to give up on someone they love but she may not be the girl for you.  I can tell you now, she is not the girl you dream that she could be.  She has her flaws and her baggage and her issues that you may not have even considered.  Being friends with her is one thing, being in a relationship with her is a whole different monster.  Let her go.  Find someone else that you might not have known for so long.  Find some random girl that you meet at a coffee shop so you can start fresh there.   Some times I think I\\'m becoming Yeezus.  I start interrupting white girls in the middle of speeches.  I get drunk and yell at people who don\\'t give me awards.  I mean seriously, that music video cost a MILLYUN DOLLAS!  I mean I try to preach the word of Yeezus, I believe that Yeezus Walks.  I model my life after him.  I mean, I break records at Louis, I eat breakfast at Gucci, my girl a superstar off of a home movie.  What more do you want? Well that\\'s not nice.   Title says \"THIS MORNING\"  I see what a lot of people are posting on here and they needn\\'t be so harsh.  None of us, other than you, know the entire situation here.  Maybe she is dealing with some outside stress that she feels that she can\\'t burden you with but ended up taking the misguided anger from said stress onto you.  Don\\'t just give up on the relationship but you have to face the issues at hand.  You have to talk to her and find out how she truly feels and once you find out, you fight, regardless of whatever hurdles you have to jump over, you fight for your marriage and you fight for your love.  Even if that love is unrequited, you fight because you love her and if you lose, then you lose but at least you will not have to live the rest of your life knowing that you never fought for her with everything you had.   Be glad it\\'s magic the gathering and not magic as in he likes bust out magic tricks when he\\'s in a crowd because he\\'s david copperfield.   Again, you are a girl.  Girl vs Children\\'s Card Game, girl wins 99.99999999999999999% of the time.   Did he not play the literal perfect game?  Not one vote was against him in the entire season and then he won the final tribal 8-0-0 No clue.  I like andrea, she never took any of the game personally which is how you are supposed to play the game.  Maybe people didn\\'t like that she didn\\'t burst out meltdown crying like dawn when she got eliminated.   Let\\'s be honest, it doesn\\'t matter if the broncos were 5th seed or the 1st seed.  It\\'s peyton manning and it\\'s the playoffs.  We all know what\\'s coming next. Physically speaking I may be unattractive.  Emotionally/Mentally speaking I am repulsive but I\\'m a decent to good actor.   I think the phrase \"sucks to suck\" was made for this situation.  You made the decision and sadly you will have to live with it now.  Sorry for the brutal honesty and good luck.  See that\\'s a very hard one.  It might change with the age of the man but it is still tough.  I guess the best way to bring it up is upfront and immediately.  \\n\\nBefore you brush this off as stupid advice, look, the longer you keep this secret, the more a guy would feel like you were keeping something from him/think you are a liar.  If you lay all the cards on the table, a man might be more accepting of it.  As a guy, I really honestly wouldn\\'t know how to handle it.  \\n\\nIt is not a deal breaker if a guy loves you but to keep it from a guy for that long is inconceivable.  I really don\\'t know.\\n\\nLook, if you are a good person, I\\'m sure there are better men than me who wouldn\\'t even care that you have herpes or whatever your past may bring.  For me personally, it would be a tough hurdle to jump over and I really don\\'t know how to bring it up.   oh jeez lady, did someone use you to get to your sister?  I\\'m sorry if they just found her more appealing with a better sense of humor.   i feel like the answer would be HELL YES.   no.  it\\'s her.  Like really, it is actually her.   NO I DO NOT THINK HIS HELMET IS THE SOURCE OF HIS POWER Yea, our offense disappeared but the 12th man got to them.  At times, it looked like the Kaep and the receivers were entirely confused.  Richard Sherman, also, is a beast.  Hopefully we get our shit together and don\\'t play Seattle in Seattle int he playoffs.   Personally speaking, I am a guy who thinks that infidelity is a complete deal breaker in any circumstance but that\\'s just because I\\'m unreasonable.  If you really love him, you can conceivably forgive him and take it back but he has more than a lot of work to do to make it up to you if that is even possible.  The issue for you may be that once a cheater, always the cheater.  Long distance relationships are hard and transgressions are easy to occur.  All in all I say give him a chance but the moment you get even a whiff of cheating, you dump him and find a guy who will love you and respect your trust.   The greatest example of this is Chris \"The Chris\" Weidman. Didn\\'t care for him until he started losing and show more of a human side. Seems like a good dude and entertaining when you get him in his element. He\\'s underrated because he has a lot of offensive weapons but he\\'s properly rated because he has one gaping defensive hole. Hit him with the overhand left. Jon Jones is basically the same as Kanye for me. No matter how much I say I\\'m over him, I\\'m one 15 second blurry video of him doing sunday service away from going back to the church of bones. Capitalism. There is a difference between extras and actors. Also, TV shows (outside of Multi-Cam sitcoms) don\\'t film week to week so that\\'s also not how that works.  Also, some blockbusters have bad acting but a lot of tv shows do to, you\\'re just not watching the bad shows.  Cuz fish filets are good  The death penalty is immoral because having the death penalty as law is to make the assumption that the justice system is flawless, that \\n100% of everyone we execute is guilty of the crimes accused. \\n\\nWhat we know, at least in America, is that the justice system isn\\'t flawless and often times discriminate against people of color.  The wait staff that is not getting tipped. It is the norm of the business. It sucks but it\\'s the social contract we\\'ve accepted.  Seek therapy. That\\'s the first step. Continuing therapy and sticking through it when you feel that it is not helping at first is the second. It ain\\'t that bad.... Ohhhhhh then in this case they should\\'ve dropped the charges long ago. My b If you\\'re doing it for a boy. Yes.\\n\\nIf you\\'re doing it to play touch butt with your stupid friends in the park. Don\\'t.  Hot Cheetos.  Naw, South American soccer tycoons exploit people too and they\\'re not white.  The exploitation the rich and powerful in sport is like the one thing that transcends race except not really.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day, regardless of if the team wins or loses, the owners will make money. The same does not apply to players. Scarlett Johansson and I guess 9 other people who are way way way way less attractive than me in every single way.  It helps our workers become massively overworked for lower pay and collectively breaks our spirits in the now 50 some odd years we need to stay in the work force.  Breh, I was talking about Jimmy Carter, you chud.  There was this carpenter dude who told people he was the son of god and people believed in.  Not sure who would be the bigger lunatic in this case.   I always back Omega.  Great quality, you can bang it against a brick wall and it won\\'t break.  Comes equipped with poison needles, sleeping gas, gps tracker dar- wait... I\\'ve said too much.  Rae Carruth. Aaron Hernandez.\\n\\nAlso, let\\'s not put Michael Vick in the same level as OJ.  Michael Vick fought dogs and was part of a dog fighting ring.  OJ brutally murdered two people.  \\n\\nRay Lewis should\\'ve ruined his career but since he continued playing a ball-based sport at a high level, people are able to look past him potentially murdering a person. \\n\\nAlso, apparently, this country hates black people peacefully protesting more than they do murderers and dog abusers because Kaepernick seems to have ruined his career and reputation beyond reproach as well.  Let me get this logic:\\n\\n1. Too many people can\\'t care of the children they have\\n\\n2. Abortion should be banned outside of special cases to teach people responsbility. \\n\\nSo that means:\\nHaving children teaches responsibility but the people who have children are not responsible enough to take care of them.\\n\\nI understand that you don\\'t understand how ass backwards the statement is but good luck, I hope you don\\'t knock up/get knocked up by someone.   Live close to work and hate other people.   That I have no moral compass.\\n\\nI don\\'t need God and the threat of eternal damnation to be a good person.  I\\'m not a good person but it has nothing to do with not believing in God.  Damn.  You are a better and more forgiving man.  Mad respect to you.   Jesus christ.  You\\'ve had sex with more girls than I\\'ve shaken hands with.   Avoid Vallejo in general.  I wouldn\\'t suggest going to Vallejo to live since the city is literally bankrupt.   Like literally bankrupt.  Not that they are poor but two years ago, the city had to file for bankruptcy.   Scenario 1: Maybe USA can win this.  We do have the most powerful army by a long long stretch at this point.  We spend way more on defense than the next 15 countries combined.  If there\\'s one thing Europe has shown is that it can definitely be invaded. I imagine the US would probably go through France and take France within maybe 2 months because, c\\'mon guys, it\\'s France.  Furthermore, Russia isn\\'t included in this definition of Europe so it would pretty much be a cake walk in a sense.  My preferred strategy would be to build the base in the Middle East and attack from there.  This way we take down the weaker Eastern European countries first (Russia isn\\'t included) and then we move from Poland to France.  Poland to France has historically been shown as the easiest route to take over Europe.  \\n\\nScenario 2: No chance Europe can invade USA.  The only way I can see it happening is that if Europe invades either Canada or Mexico first and then from there (full conquer/control of either country) they can attack America.  The issue/difference between the European continent and the American continent is that there are alternative routes that can be take to the European continent that are reasonable.  America can attack Europe from Africa or from Asia (From the middle east).  To attack America, realistically speaking, you have 2 routes.  East Coast or West Coast.  The US won\\'t allow an enemy country to take over Mexico or Canada without putting up a fight first.  So the only strategy that seems possible at this point would be an attack on the east coast with the point of entry probably from Maine.  This will end in European forces getting sunk right outside of Maine.  I don\\'t think the European forces ever even reaching American land.  \\n\\nScenario 3: in this case, the European forces may have a chance.  The British have a great Navy but in the end of the day, everything in war comes down to one word.  Technology.  And how is Technology improved?  Money.  America spends more on defense than the next 15 countries combined.  There\\'s really no chance anyone beats america in an all out war for destruction.  We can level countries in the matter of days.  Building nations, guerilla warfare, winning hearts and minds, that\\'s where we can lose a war but if it\\'s WW2 style destruction?  No country can beat us.   Dawg, this shit funny as fuck tho Are we sure there\\'s a woman even at 125 that can compete with Suarez in wrestling? It means he\\'s fuckin.  He\\'s fuckin.  He\\'s fuckin something.  Might not be you but homie is fuckin.  *our dad Organic household products.  Guys, floor cleaner is floor cleaner is floor cleaner.  It\\'s all toxic.  Just don\\'t drink them and keep your windows open.   Always loved DC\\'s walkout. The song is definitely super dad and he comes out with everything high waisted and tucked in.  I think this is literally the story for Brokeback Mountain.  Good luck man, I hope you find happiness with this guy or someone else.  You can be on a scale of homosexuality.  You might be in the middle and bisexual.  That\\'s great.  Just find out what you want.   That corporations can freely donate to political campaigns and we have to believe that that doesn\\'t lead to any sort of corruption. well fuck her for being an independent woman who doesn\\'t really need to discuss what she does with her own body to the man.   If it\\'s so arbitrary, just let it go.  If it makes her happy, just do it.  It\\'s not an unreasonable demand, she\\'s not asking you to jump off of a bridge for her.  She\\'s asking you to cut back on your drinking and if you love her, just do it because you love her and want to make her happy for the rest of her life.  Duh.   Luke, Reyes, Jan, Nikky Thrills, Johnny Walker. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, Jon has. I think punishing someone because someone else\\'s boss is an asshole is also asshole behavior.  Derrick Lewis was the undercover MVP of the night and this line was the underrated MVP of the post fight speech. Everyone remembers that his balls was hot but USA is always up in dis hoe.  Dexter the book.  Corrected. Same point. It\\'s very difficult to legally prove someone is lying to defame someone else. Doesn\\'t mean she did or did not lie. Only talking about the legal side.  The mighty elephant does not concern itself with the opinions of lowly ants.  I think he was triggered.  I am very uncomfortable with the word \"niggle\" right now.  It\\'s quite simple.  I wouldn\\'t want any of my friends and family that are women to be discriminated against.   Dat angst is so real.  \\n\\nMaybe try not sounding super intense all the time.  It\\'s not your face, it\\'s what you do with your face that may be off putting breh.   Due to the prevalence of phones and cameras, as well as the overall progress in technology, it has been easier to catch murderers before they go on a killing spree.  Therefore, it would be safe to assume (it is never safe to assume) that we are catching serial killers earlier on.\\n\\nAnother hypothesis is that the mass shootings are happening so frequently, it is covering the news and spread of stories of serial killers.  News outlets want to cover mass shootings more because mass shootings tend to kill more people than even the most prolific of serial killers.\\n\\nMass shootings have taken over the news because the prevalence of assault weapons and weapons in general.  We have seen a steady increase in the purchase of firearms in America and the more readily available guns are, the less likely we have a mass stabbing.  In 2004, the ten year ban on assault weapons placed in 1994 expired allowing any normal citizen to buy assault weapons.  This in addition to gunshow loopholes as well as lax gun laws in certain states makes federal regulation of guns very difficult.  \\n\\nBut some people will say that guns don\\'t kill people, people kill people.  To that I say, guns don\\'t kill people, people with guns kill a shit ton more people than people with knives.   Sons of Anarchy had a great music supervisor who had a ton of folk songs and folk versions of songs and covers of classic songs on.   A tie between lacrosse and intramural football.  Friday Night Lights\\n\\nFuturama (Kinda.  Comedy Central seasons are weak but the series finale [actual, real series finale] is fan-fucking-tastic.)\\n\\nJustified.  Just maintains excellence throughout the entire series.\\n\\nThe Shield.  One of the best endings for a tv show ever.\\n\\n I will give you the entire south for literally any part of Canada.   Heartbreaking.  \\n\\nAs a minority in America, I\\'m sure we\\'ve all felt that being a different race would make our lives better but it\\'s not something we can do.  \\n\\nWe must learn to find the positives of our ethnic make up, whatever they may be.  What it seems right now is that you\\'ve surrounded yourself with bad people.  If you\\'re still in school (K-12) it\\'s tough for everyone but later on, at some point, you\\'ll learn to embrace your culture and ethnic make up in a positive light.  \\n\\nYou\\'ve been blessed with a lot! Mixed race is god\\'s photoshop.  You\\'re also benefiting with growing up with two starkly different cultural mindsets as well as an important one that\\'s all to yourself.  You\\'ll know the struggles that white people deal with, black people deal with as well as what bi-racial people deal with.  \\n\\nIf you embrace these ideas and learn as much as you can, you can become a person with legitimacy and knowledge of so many different viewpoints.  \\n\\nI urge you to listen to [Ebro Darden on the Juan Epstein podcast](https://soundcloud.com/rosenbergradio/ebro-on-juan-epstein-part-1)\\n\\nEbro Darden is a bi-racial man (White mother, black father) who has now become a very prominent and important person in American culture.  In this pod, he talks about growing up in Northern California and struggling with something similar to you.  He was too black for white people and too white for black people and he talks about how he dealt with his personal struggles.   I\\'m just a simple man but I\\'m going to guess treating them like a human being and not just a sex object as something that may turn women on.  \\n\\nAlso, maybe having an honest conversation and not just always trying to get some.   Donald wants to ban all Muslims and is reaching a Hitlerian level of of absurd xenophobia/discriminatory rhetoric.  All Kanye ever did was interrupt Taylor Swift and dropped some truth.   Except it can.  Because there are legal limits to all of the amendments.   Real friends/good friends always welcome you back with open arms.  They should understand that what you\\'ve been through has been traumatic and be supportive instead of being dicks who felt that you abandoned them.  Those aren\\'t the type of people you need in your life anyways.   This is a game changer.  Never thought about it that way but you are totally correct.  I\\'m a dude.... The 98 Hornets immediately post Vlade.   Every southern state flag modeled after it should definitely be removed.  My argument is that if the Germans don\\'t allow Nazi symbolism on their governmental designs, we shouldn\\'t either because we are better than those damn krauts.  Yes, I understand that there is some colloquial irony here.  \\n\\nHowever, even more strongly than the Confederate flags being removed, I am more than adamant about renaming government institutions named after Confederate leaders.  Jefferson Davis was anti-American.  He was so anti-American, he supported secession from The United States of America. \\n\\nAlso, all of the Confederacy is a symbol for slavery because one of the biggest reasons for its existence is that they wanted slavery to continue existing.  Because they supported the owning of black people.  I\\'m just saying that that\\'s kinda fucked up dontcha think? Canada because they would undeniably be partnered with the U.S. and risk significantly less troops.  So I may not even have to go to war.   You mean the waitstaff who all look like a rough 55 but are actually 18? Denny\\'s.  I just feel like there is humidified grease everytime i walk into one.  Turn down for what? A musical instrument.  I\\'ve played multiple instruments, each for extended times and I only end up being okay at them.  Don\\'t got it in me to be great.   No one really cares about you unless you give them a reason to care about you.  \\n\\n So, because this man is a convicted felon and a wanted man with a history of violent encounters, he was righteously executed on a sidewalk.  Because of the sins of the past should forever haunt the individual.   Still doesn\\'t mean he should\\'ve been killed.   So you can find a new girl and then break up with her and then find a new girl and then break up with her and get in as many different viewpoints and experiences before you settle down for good? Not different.  That\\'s like saying Shit or a two syllable shi-et.  It\\'s the same fucking word and conjours the same meaning.  That \"er\" and \"a\" argument has always, ALWAYS been people trying to justify using that word.  My group of black friends love using the word but I don\\'t because I shouldn\\'t use it and they are allowed to.  Simple as that.  Yes there are terms and phrases that are exclusive to a certain ethnicity.  Deal with it people.   First and most importantly, \"obfuscate\" is such a fucking great word.  Nice use of diction, you already earn many points. \\n\\nSecondly, if there\\'s one thing I fucking hate in this world are gay bashers.  I am a straight male that is entirely comfortable with my own sexuality so what the hell does it matter if someone else is gay, lesbian, bisexual or trans??  \\n\\nThis guy, Andrew, can eat shit.  I know a lot of people with sympathize with people like Andrew who are so uncomfortable with their own sexuality that they have to outright hate gay people and make others feel horrible because he can\\'t deal with himself.  Fuck him.  The damage he has done to gay people and the bullying he has probably done in his life cannot be excused just because he was confused.  You should tell Candace if for nothing but to stop her from dating this insufferable cunt.\\n\\nNo sympathy for him.  You should have absolutely no sympathy for Andrew.  You should blow his cover and out him publicly.  I know you shouldn\\'t out anyone and that is the worst thing in the world but guess what, if you are a gay bashing homophobe that makes other people\\'s lives miserable, well you deserved getting outted.   Dude... He\\'s a football player that got a 3.9.  Who cares?  He was a smart dude who was a great football player.\\n\\nI\\'m a niners fan and there\\'s a lot of shitty things about Richard Sherman but his SAT score is not one of those things.  There\\'s a chance he found out Stanford wanted him before he even took the SATs so why even care?  Seriously, you need to stop.  \\n\\nHe\\'s a great player who is a total dick.  That\\'s who he is.  I hate him because he\\'s a dick and a seahawk but I don\\'t judge him for having a 990 SAT.  That score means absolutely dick.   Don\\'t act like you wouldn\\'t blow him too.   Someone has anger issues.  Maybe being a bitch his entirely life has done something to his brain.   You\\'re not a douchebag (well save for the Bo Burnham thing) but you need to put the ball in her court.  Be available for her and basically say \"I love you, if you love me, you make the move.\"   Here\\'s a very quick tip if you want to save a little bit of money.  Splurge a lot on a good chef\\'s knife (get a sharpening stone and such to maintain it) but splurge a lot on it.  Get a very good chef\\'s knife and a bread knife and you won\\'t need another knife at all.  Fillet knives and cleavers and that such aren\\'t necessary.   James Roday and Dule hill are just better actors than Zach Braff and Petey from Remember the Titans.  Also, Maggie lawson is soooooooo much better than Sarah Chalke in every way it\\'s not even funny.   The international box office is now very important but it still doesn\\'t trump the domestic box office.  Most movies make the larger portion of their movies domestically while the international market is too vast and too diverse to cater to specifically.   It isn\\'t even the fact that he\\'s the CEO of anything.  It\\'s saying that \"crazy, homeless, drug dealers, dropouts, and trash\" are \"grotesque\" and the incessant complaining when he can take steps to help with the problem instead.  Well here\\'s the thing.  The 49ers are going to be the 6th seeded team in the NFL and January is during the playoffs.  There won\\'t be any games that are going to be played.  \\n\\nI so wish you could see a live game and experience the excitement that a crowd brings but sadly, you may not get the opportunity to see the 49ers play.  I hope you have fun in SF, I suggest going to Ike\\'s Place for a sandwich (best sandwich in the state, no, in the world).   Ohhhh so this is the moment he started to become white. Well Tyson obviously needs one right about now.  It was painful watching him waste that one.  I know it\\'s tough to trust ciera but you should trust her and then use it to break a 3-3 tie.   Oh heya, I\\'m also moving to LA in January.  Sadly, however, I will not be going to USC so I\\'m looking at places in a different area.  Good luck, I\\'ll definitely be looking back to this for what everyone else on Reddit suggests and take it into consideration.   The only thing one can control is one\\'s own reaction and actions towards the world.  You cannot dictate what he does and you can only choose to react whatever way you react.  You are not at fault here.  He obviously still harbors some ill will towards you.  The only thing in this world that you can absolutely control is your emotions and reactions towards circumstances that surround your life.  If you choose to feel like a failure, it is your choice and your own feelings.  You can choose to disregard him.  If he treats you badly, then you start ignoring him.  Just because you see him everyday does not mean you have to absolutely talk to him every day.   I agree with you but the issue is that our best offensive weapon is frank gore.  In a spread style attack, it would rely heavily on 3 things the niners can\\'t really do at the moment.  \\n\\n1) Kaepernick would need to work on his footwork on 3 steps and 5 steps.  He drops and then zips the ball.  I rarely ever see 3 steps in the current offense and when I do, it is an incompletion and it seems that Kap is uncomfortable in the drop.\\n\\n2) Kap needs to work on his read progression skills.  He often goes to the 1 receiver and then to Vernon and then outlet pass.  He needs to learn to see all receiving options from 1-(x) and then back to 1. \\n\\n3) We need decent receivers for the WC offense or even the spread.  Our third ranking receiver on the team is our fullback, bruce miller.  That is not okay and while some of the onus is on Kap a lot of it is on the WRs other than Boldin.  Kyle Williams and Jonathan Baldwin are people who would drop wide open passes.  No one would ever trust in throwing the ball to them.\\n\\nThe current offensive philosophy (because Jim Harbaugh is a true WC guy) is that the lack of depth in WR forces the Niners to play this way.  They have no other choice than to let Frank run 30 times a game because Kyle Williams is incapable of catching anything and he is our second receiver.  Defense know that if they simply double team davis and boldin, the rest of the eligible receivers will drop the balls.  In the NFL, there is no possible way that a linebacker should be able to guard a receiver but other than Boldin, I would argue that some DE\\'s can guard our receivers.   Three words to solve your problem: Fuck Someone New.  #FSN all day.   So this was before he started playing for the steelers? That is a very very broad question.

On the way out, if she\\'s also leaving, you can nod and say hi or if she is a regular, you can say hi but don\\'t hit on her in the gym.  Just don\\'t.   Also, I never saw any of what you did was wrong if all of this is true.  You helped her leave an abusive husband and she helped you get through an, what seems like, extremely rough time in your life.  The fact that you found each other saved each of you respectively.  I\\'m glad you\\'re better now and this is just a great story all around.   It\\'s not nothing. 130k in LA is pretty comfortable. Bruh, the UFC got in the Mayhem Miller business and that dude is legitimately unhinged.  Yes.  move on.  You don\\'t need that attitude anyways.  The real surprising fact is that dating is funner with a person who wants to date you back.  As much as we want someone we can\\'t get, life is better with someone you know likes you back.

As I said in a post from a different... uhhh... post.  Most republicans and most conservatives are reasonable people.   You are my favorite type of person.

The fact that it\\'s on tv and there is no such thing as \"reality tv\".  Use of narcotics. Specifically just the use.   \"I like where your nose is positioned on your face.\" Norway and Sweden are two countries with great healthcare, great education system, and their criminal justice system is 30% lower in recidivism rate.  \\n\\nWe don\\'t think white people suck.  White people are awesome.  All races of people are awesome.  We just don\\'t like racists, bigots, and religious zealots no matter what race they are.  And in this country, due to it\\'s past and current power structures, there are a lot of white people that still harbor those traits that we don\\'t like.\\n\\nWe also don\\'t think rich people are greedy pricks.  We just don\\'t like rich people who continually exploit others, the environment, and our financial system.  And it\\'s not even that we don\\'t like those people, we just don\\'t like our system and want to fix it.  We get that people who run giant corporations only have one goal, make money.  That\\'s totally fine, that\\'s their job and it\\'s what they should do.  We just want to close those loopholes and fix our financial system so that they don\\'t have monumental gains off the backs of the poorest people in the country.   Jon Stewart would be dope.   I\\'m pretty close to you.  I\\'d call it 60% Ali outlasts Tyson and 40% Tyson knocks out Ali.   Okay, everyone here is lying to themselves if they think there aren\\'t degrees of cheating.  You\\'re saying that it would be exactly the same to you if your SO was emotionally connected to a man across the country or if he/she was railed by three dudes at the same time?  Please.   Well she can go fuck herself with a jesus dick.  You do you, boo and stop worrying about her.  The only one who can control whether or not she is pissed off is her and she\\'s gonna have to deal with her own head.   Well step 1. grow confidence  2. go bald.   Is there a difference between motherfucker and muthafuckas?  Just because you pronounce a word slightly different doesn\\'t change the history of that word.  That word has been used by white people to oppress black people through American history.  Now, sure, this is America, anyone can use the word but if you\\'re a non-black person using that word, you are either ignorant or know the full history of the word and still use it because you are an asshat.  \\n\\nWhat you don\\'t realize is that when most people hear that word whether it ends in \"er\" or \"a\", the word still evokes the idea of oppression and racism.  I think it\\'s a better policy to use neither word in the strive for being a better human being .  Apparently you absolutely love using that word so there\\'s no stopping your justifications.     Firstly, how the fuck do you label the Niners as \"dirty\".  \\n\\nSecondly, Jim Harbaugh is \"exactly like Jim Schwartz, only with discipline and success.\" Oh so you mean he\\'s nothing at all like Jim Schwartz.  \\n\\nThirdly USA today got me so fucked up, I\\'m defending the Seahawks.  Pete Caroll being excited about his team is a reason to dislike him?  I guess everyone in the league should have Mike Shanahan mean mugging his team all the time right?\\n\\n\\nTo quote an iconic rant on youtube, \"USA TODAY, YOU SUCK BALLS!!!\" Oh you gonna downvote me?  Bitch move, breh.  Bitch.  Move.  I see how it is.  Bitch ass fool.   Michael Crabtree isn\\'t like Rice at all.  \\n\\nAlso comparing Vernon Davis to Tony Gonzalez is comical.  Gonzalez is nowhere near as fast.  Vernon Davis is used as a deep threat, Gonzalez is a check down.  Davis is first look.  Gonzalez is safety net.  Entirely different players.  Doesn\\'t matter if the numbers are the same, they aren\\'t the same type of player.  Is it that hard to understand?  You are waaaaay off.\\n\\nI also want you to note that the 1995 49ers lost to the Green Bay Packers in the playoffs in the divisional round.  I don\\'t know what type of shoe you have up your ass but you need to learn about football.  You\\'re looking at the story line, not the player.  Kaepernick took over after Alex Smith got injured.  Steve Young took over after Montana got injured, lost the job to Montana and then they traded Montana and got the job.  That\\'s the similarity.  \\n\\nSteve Young was an okay runner at best and he relied much more heavily on his arm.  He was competent in the short passing game with the added ability of a long game.  Kaepernick is an excellent runner and relies on his legs more than Young did.  Kaepernick\\'s short game is not great but his deep ball is okay.  \\n\\nCrabtree is not going to make it to the hall of fame if he\\'s going on this same pace.  Shit, he hasn\\'t even made a pro bowl so please, calm the fuck down with the HOF talk.  Vernon Davis might make it to the hall of fame but if he retired today, he won\\'t even be considered.  Frank Gore will make it to the 49ers hall but in the NFL HOF?  He\\'s not going to be a first ballot HOFer.  Roger Craig won 3 superbowls and he\\'s not even in the HOF so seriously, calm the fuck down bitch.  Just wait a bit to text her and also, awkward end of date pleasantries are always a little tricky.  Just chalk it up to being nervous and tell her how you just don\\'t know how to handle yourself and she\\'ll forgive you and potentially find it endearing.  Just be honest about it all, girls dig honesty.  Well, guys dig honesty too.  People in general dig honesty.   Well, Gerard Butler did leave a bunch of spartans to their deaths so i guess he can fight.  Christian bale beat up Bane though.  I mean, league of shadows training is pretty hardcore so I don\\'t see Bale losing.  \\nWait excuse me for a moment.\\nOh.\\nOh....\\nOkay, well apparently those are all fictional events.  Sorry.   niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccce Vance MacDonald is Vernon 2.0?  In what universe?   We are seriously the best fanbase in sports.   Depends on the location of the foul.  If it\\'s holding inside the end zone that would be an interesting question.  I would imagine that would be a safety.  It\\'s not the location of the ball during returns, its location of the foul.  Although that depends a lot of what type of foul it is.   Your friend has GOTS TA GO!  You can\\'t have some negative jealousness drag you down.  I would make like Ray Guy and PUNT!  If she thinks that your getting paid too much to be friends then drop her like its hot.  The Seahawks are basically the clippers: Sucked for most of their history but is getting really hot right now with a few stars, still may amount to nothing at all though.  \\nThe Steelers are the Celtics: Most championships among all teams, long tradition of winning, gritty, not always glitz and glamour.  \\nDallas might be the Lakers: Second most championships won championships in multiple time periods, big name recognition, glitz and glamour with big named guys throughout history.  \\nThe Niners are the Bulls: super strong at one point in time due to having the best player(s) in the history of the game and now trying to regain past glory in the hands of a young star that may or may not be the second coming.  \\nThe Raiders would probably be the Pistons: They had a mean streak and a storied tradition of attitude.  They may not be very good as of late but people know what Raiders (Pistons) Football (Basketball) is.  It\\'s hard nosed, it\\'s gritty and it is sometimes a little dirty.  \\n So I\\'m really the only one that thinks that cheating isn\\'t always the worst thing you can do in a relationship?  I mean, each relationship is a whole different thing and everything in relationships can be considered gray area.  Having a zero tolerance policy is not always the best thing to have.   What if Boston Rob chose Jenna Lewis instead of Amber?\\nWhat if Micronesia was a final three instead of a final two?\\nWhat if Penner hadn\\'t turned on Chadam, Parv, Candice, and Nate?\\n The first question has to be: Do you love her?  If you do, you should stick by her through this.  \\n\\nAn eating disorder is like an addiction, it is a disease.  You can\\'t treat it by yourself and you need to seek help from a professional just like any type of disease.  Think about it, Alcoholics Anonymous is there for alcoholics who obviously can\\'t get it together themselves.  Seek help from a professional before she does irreparable damage to herself.\\n\\nAs for her getting angry when you mention it, imagine, again, the alcoholics analogy.  When you tell an alcoholic that he or she is an alcoholic, they get pissed off.  Then the question is about how much you love her.  Do you love her enough to let her hit rock bottom?  The following is going to sound absolutely stupid and crazy but you have to tell her that if she doesn\\'t seek professional help (with the stipulation that you must go along to make sure she gets the help) that you will leave her and if she gets mad or angry or says no the help, you leave her.  Just leave.  \\n\\nOnce she hits bottom, she will do one of two things, seek help or waste away. The hard part is that you have to let her hit bottom and then steer her towards help.  You cannot change her, she can only change herself but you can *help*.  Also you cannot decide that she needs help, she needs to decide that.  If she only goes to help begrudgingly, she will not get better.  Even if she says yes to help to keep you around, if you don\\'t see the issue getting better, you tell her that you are leaving and then, this is the most important part, *you actually leave her and the relationship* as hard as it sounds.  It\\'s tough, very tough, but if you want her to save herself, you have to make the decision to leave.   Ain\\'t nothing wrong with greg roman.  It\\'s hard to work with no receivers.  I don\\'t see anythign wrong with the play calling recently.  The only glaring issue I\\'ve seen is that it seems that they abandon the run sometimes which, for the niners, is a mistake.   I support this because I really don\\'t want to see Pretty Tony Pettis get bodied. Protect Pretty Tony at all cost.  The only shame is that we never saw the war between the King of Rio and the God of all beings.  Good luck with that, g. Just give into your earthly desires. It\\'s so much more fun.  Stopped watching the NFL (and football as a whole) after the Ray Rice domestic abuse case. Surprisingly easy even though football was everything to me. Every time I had the urge to come back, NFL or NCAA would do something horrendous and I\\'d continue the boycott. \\n\\nHow I knew I would never come back to football was the blackballing of Kaepernick. That eradicated the last shred and desire to care about football at all.  Remember the old ugly ass mmafighting.com logo? It\\'s really the Face the Pain of logos.  I\\'m upset\\nFifty thousand on my head, it\\'s disrespect \"One requires brutal honesty, deals directly with reality, and is the highest level of humanity\\'s physical evolution and the other is MMA.\" Neither of them will get the next crack at Khabib regardless.  If both Conor or Tony are unavailable, Max Holloway (if he beats Ortega) would have just as much, if not more of, a chance to fight Khabib.  It\\'s under article 10.018 - *Weight Allowances* Provision #7.43 under NYSAC Combat Sports rulebook.  Oooh I want to play this game.\\n\\nOr Darren Till (controversial) It\\'s not that I don\\'t believe him, it\\'s that I don\\'t believe him. Amendment 28: No sex in the champagne room.   Just hand out the accounting books.  If you\\'re the world\\'s largest corporation, you\\'ve done some shady shit to some lotta people.   No, I\\'m the type that says that if you live in Newark and work in Manhattan, you can\\'t call yourself a New Yorker.   Brandon Hantz I live in a cocooned world where I can love and marry whomever I want whether my parents like it or not.  If that\\'s my cocooned world, then I think my cocooned world would be superior to a lot of other worlds.   That would be considered safety. If you even touch outside of the endzone you are considered in play.  Lets say he intercepts it in the endzone.  No one touches him.  He runs out of the endzone.  Then he decides touchback is better, he runs back into the endzone and kneels.  That\\'s a safety.   Homeboy needs to stop complaining and try to do something about the problem.  If he\\'s just gonna sit there and bitch and whine then he should leave.  Hey, if you are bothered by the homeless people and drug dealers, find the source of the problem, then try and eradicate the problem.  Or you can just sit on your throne and complain about the peasant folk.  What an asshat.   Is he a bad qb since week 2?  yes\\nIs he the worst passer?  No.\\n\\nIncompletions and lack of yards are still not as important as interceptions.  He\\'s thrown a few INTs but certainly not as much as someone like Geno Smith.   Superman duh.  Vegeta\\'s trademark throughout the entire DBZ/GT series is that he\\'s super fucking angry and he begins super cool and then ends up getting his ass kicked sideways.  Not entirely wrong.  Strength of schedule is on the list but in this exact case, Niners and Seahawks will be decided by the provision that is directly ahead of strength of schedule.  It is called Strength of Victory.  Virtually speaking, it is the same idea but because division rivals often have very similar schedules, this boils down to a couple of teams.  This is decided by the combine record of of the teams that each has beaten.  In this case, Green Bay winning out would decide between the niner\\'s seahawks.  However if a tie does occur, strength of schedule is ruled in which also considers the amount of travel.   Yea but her competitors were sooooo weak.  No one ever challenged her.  Her season was lopsided moreso than redemption island when Boston Rob ran the show.  I would put her under Boston Rob, tied with JT and definitely above Rob C.\\n\\nThe problem is strength of schedule.  Boston Rob would have won All Stars if he had chosen to bring Jenna lewis to final tribal but in the end he brought amber, lost by 1 vote and then married into the million dollars which, I mean in a way, a win for Rob anyways.  In All Stars, Rob went up against Rupert, Tina Wesson, Colby Donaldson, and Hatch himself and he almost won it.  If it wasn\\'t for the foolish disregard for immunity idols, who knows what BR would have done in Heroes vs Villains.  \\n\\nIn the list of best survivors ever, I would put Parv, Sandra, BR, Hatch, and maybe a few others on the top tier.  Then I would put Yul Kwon, JT, Kim, and Cochran on one tier.  Then Russell Hantz on that third tier all alone.  And then the rest.   Because we are a wild card team and dallas is winning the division.  5th and 6th seed are wild card teams.  1-4 seeds are division winners.  NFC West is led by Seattle right now.  Yea, that is exactly what I said, I don\\'t understand why you are having a huge issue.  Also, \"alright money\" would mean you don\\'t need a day job, it would mean that your writing would be your day job.  A massive majority of writers don\\'t make enough to sustain themselves without having a job on the side.  Those aren\\'t bad examples of successful authors because 1. They are successful authors.  2. They are successful authors.  So where\\'s your issue? well gee, someone\\'s taking this personally.  Did a girl break your little heart? can I get a collective BUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSHIIIIIIIIT Snitch ass narc.  Not how this works, b.  Put some respeck on the god. It\\'s Artem, Jon, and Cain in that order.  It\\'s not something you can choose.  People don\\'t wake up one day and decide that they are into the same gender.  It is driven by innate urges.  People will love who they love.   LOLOLOLOLOLOL that would require the republicans to have any sort of courage.  Maybe you\\'re the one who is getting butthurt too easily. Need a safe space? First song they played for me was \\'bout their friend that just died\\nTextin\\' and drivin\\' down Mulholland Drive\\nThat\\'s why I\\'d rather take the 405 Chilis tend to grow better in arrid climates.  This is the correct one. Manny was out cold for 5 minutes To be fair to her, this is true.  They did not cancel the trial and worked to get artists paid during the free trial.  That I did like.   So the information I see is that Caesar\\'s Legion maxed out at about 6500 men.  They carried a wooden shield covered with leather and metal which, without a doubt, can be pierced by a bullet.  They also carried a shortsword and a javelin to throw which is deadly and accurate within about 30 feet as tested by The Deadliest Warrior.  \\n\\nThe new General Dynamics APC developed for the Marines holds 2 crew mmebers and 8-9 people.  Seeing as each APC only has to carry two people, that leaves lets call it 6.5 soldiers worth of weight that can be used for ammo instead.  Lets say each Marine averages out to 200 pounds with gear on (which is lowballing it) so each APC can carry 1300 pounds of ammunition and multiply that by 25 which would be a total of 32,500 pounds of ammunition.  Standard issue for SEALs is the M4A1 which uses 5.56 mm Nato rounds.  100 of these rounds would weigh 3lbs.  If i did my math right, 25 APCs holding 100 SEALs can carry roughly over a million rounds of 5.56.  \\n\\nNow the issue is that the SEALs are invading a city and the Romans are on the defensive.  So theoretically if the Romans just stay inside the city walls, the SEALs would find it very hard to move in.  However, with the amount of ammunition the SEALs have and the fact that their M4A1\\'s have the range much much farther than any weapon that Caesar\\'s army had, its pretty inconceivable that the SEALs would lose.  Even if the Roman\\'s bum rushed 6000 men at the SEALs, they could start picking off the Romans 300 meters before the Romans could step close to them.  And I haven\\'t even considered the other weaponry that the SEALs are trained to use such as grenades, long-range sniper rifles, grenade launchers/attachments, heavy machineguns.  Even if Caesar had an army of 10,000, I don\\'t see Roman\\'s winning because of their technological disadvantage.   Dude, they were even chanting USA even in Round 1, BEFORE the bludgeoning (also, like forreals, what a goddamn good use of bludgeoning).  It doesn\\'t happen often because it\\'s extremely hard to get evidence of someone lying about domestic battery.\\n\\nTake it to an extreme: if she accidentally sent the cops a text stating she made this up to hurt Nick, they would prosecute her. \\n\\nThey literally just don\\'t have the evidence.

Here you go https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCCnj1U3sO4 So your confession is that you were an entrepreneur. This is not a confession, it\\'s a humble brag.  Being an adult is doing things you don\\'t want to do. Go to the interview, you don\\'t have to take the job but if your friend has done so much for you, the least you can do is show up.  the one thing I contend with is that the KO combo was shown from the other side. It actually wasn\\'t. All of the footage in promo we\\'ve seen of the KO is with Cody on the right and TJ on the left (where you can see Cody\\'s eyes as he drops) but in the original broadcast, Cody was on the left and TJ on the right (we don\\'t see the actual punch that knocks him down) just like it is in the Free Fight. \\n\\nI know this because someone (not me) has an (allegedly) illegal download of original broadcast that he/she/they go back to and rewatch on an (alleged) weekly basis. \\n\\n Holy fuck, you needa stop if you\\'re touting the agricultural powerhouse that is New York state.  They probably won\\'t go down closer to tip off.\\n\\nAs for the second question, it\\'s because they are the clippers, they  were the clippers, and will always be the clippers. Because no matter how good they are, they will always be the clippers. They cover up Laker banners with giant pictures of players because they have nothing else to hang up.   Not to mention intentionally setting up someone so that you can sue them is such a dick move that I hope your script sucks and fails.   People who are anti-gay marriage.  Not because they dislike gay marriage, more of the logical inconsistencies.  \\n\\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\\n\\nBeing anti-gay marriage has always been a religious opposition.  Therefore, passing anti-gay marriage laws is both respecting an establishment of religion (the anti-gay folks) and prohibiting the free exercise thereof (the pro-gay folks).   Condit got robbed and I love it.

How does dinner sound?\"   TV Shows are more popular than ever (as a whole) but television as the medium is growing more unpopular.  People watch tv on the computer which means they aren\\'t watching tv.  Survivor doesn\\'t pull the same way that these shows do because there are so many other shows out there plus all of those shows (relatively speaking because of the differences between cable and network) pull more viewers.  \\n\\nAlso, you need to know that the important demographic that has the social penetration (weird word, technical term) is the 18-49 demo which is the most important and it can\\'t be quantified.  Mad Men gets 4 million views which is pretty good for a cable show but everyone knows the image of Don Draper smoking a cigarette even if they don\\'t watch the show.  It\\'s that young audience that they caught and the young audience loses their attention very quickly.  Look at it now, Mad Men is now considered a thing of the past.  Survivor has gone 27 seasons, that\\'s ancient history by this point.  Hell, Survivor was never quite as popular as American Idol was at its height and even now, no one can name the last five american idol winners.  No one can name The Voice winner and the season ended on tuesday and The Voice gets 15 or so million viewers.  \\n\\nIt\\'s really tough now for tv shows to gain traction and it\\'s pretty much impossible to keep them.  For a reality competition show, it\\'s pretty much impossible.   Well if you spell it MacDonald\\'s, you\\'ll probably be fine because they spell it McDonalds.  You can escape possible lawsuits because big corporations like McDonalds will not bother to sue you because it isn\\'t worth their legal department\\'s time.  Local venues cannot sue you for \"slander\" because they have to prove that what you say isn\\'t entirely true.  Plus with disclaimers of how your book is a fictional work and all resemblances in real life are purely coincidental, it will be hard to sue you.  Most preferably you would not use small local venues and only use big corporations.   The thing is, there is a way that works out for Vytas.  It\\'s a big risk but if he wins it all the way out on redemption island, there\\'s no way he doesn\\'t win the entire game.  I mean, wants to make up for his past wrongs and win everyone\\'s heart.   but.  but.  but.  zero dark thirty and also bin laden.  \\n\\nyou\\'re probably right but I just want to believe our boys can do anything.  Plus, again, we have long range snipers that theoretically have a half a mile range.  We park our asses half a mile away from their city (remember we start 30 miles away) and start sniping away.   Fuck them bitches.  You do you and don\\'t even care about their stupid judgment.  If you were a guy, no one would be slut shaming you.  You are having a good time are you are 20.  I mean seriously, what do they want?  Do they want you to settle down at 20 years old?  20?!?!?!?!  You tell them, \"Bitch please, Ima do me and you do you.\"  \\n\\nFuck \"womanly duties\" that\\'s some misogynist bullshit.  God it makes me pissed off that people are judging you for what you do.  Are you hurting anyone?  No.  Are you having fun?  If you are then fuck them.  You\\'re 20.  You aren\\'t settling down.   I agree.  Alex Smith is the type of guy who had shit thrown at him and never complained about it.  He shows up, he works hard and he knows he will never be one of the greats yet it doesn\\'t deter him.  He realizes that at his peak, he will never be a top 10 quarterback but he still continues to work hard.  You have to admire a guy like that.

I\\'m glad that you realize your prejudices so that you can work in ridding them.  If the racism you feel is only towards hispanics, there are a many sources that you can read to rid yourself of these feelings.  At the end of the day, a white american, a black american, a latino american, and an asian american are still that key word, American.  I am an Asian American born and raised in this great country and I love this country.  I didn\\'t join the military not because I am unwilling to die for this country but because I\\'m a giant pussy who is definitely not good enough to represent this country.

Many Hispanic Americans in this country feel the same way I do.  We love this country just as much as you do.  We all feel some sort of prejudice and discriminatory thoughts but the key is to work on ridding ourselves of them.  Don\\'t be too harsh on yourself.  You aren\\'t blindly promoting racism, you are aware that you are being prejudice and a lot of people who are raised in an environment of racism work their entire lives to make themselves better.  You realize this and if you work on educating yourself and debunking these thoughts, you\\'ll be a better person for it.   He obvious didn\\'t have your back and let you sit in jail for 8 days.  Seriously, what type of brother does that?  You should cut him out entirely unless he cuts the sister, Erica, out of their lives.  Be stern about it but don\\'t make a spectacle.  Just leave and let your brother be.  Interface sucks on the computer but with mobile and apple tv, it works fine. Also the connectivity is outstanding. I rewatch the Lineker fight a lot and fucking god it must be frustrating to fight TJ. You just gotta worry about too much and that\\'s before the stance switching.  So.... I mean the statement that TJ had 0 title defenses is wrong? At the time he had already had 2 title defenses and now he has 3.  Bernie Sanders isn\\'t a communist, he is a democratic socialism.  The two are extremely different forms of government.  Democratic socialism is similar to governments in England or France.  Communist is China or North Korea.  \\n\\nIn this case, I support Bernie because of most of his tenants in democratic socialism.  Healthcare in the richest nation this planet has ever seen should not be a luxury, it should be a right.  Higher education should not be only available to those who can afford it, higher education should be provided to everyone.  Minorities should not be disenfranchised by the power establishment in this country.   In Fight one or two: Homosexual me would win every time.  I am so out of shape it isn\\'t funny.  Gay me would probably be much more tone because his boyfriend loves to work out and pushes him to be more.  Straight me is single and lazy as balls.   Here\\'s what you do:\\n\\n1. Be apologetic about it even though you shouldn\\'t. \"I\\'m sorry to be intrusive but I got your number from (sister in law)\"\\n\\n2. Be forward.  \"I thought you were really cool and I was wondering if we could go out for drinks (coffee, dinner) sometime?\"\\n\\n3. Be carefree. \"Feel free to right me off as a total creeper though.\"\\n\\n4. Be sappy. \"But I felt like I would really regret it if I didn\\'t at least give it a shot.\"\\n\\n Well okay then.  She went out with a known philanderer and only blames you for something she did 5 years ago.  Look, if she doesn\\'t want you as a friend because of that, then forget her.  She ain\\'t even worth your time.  You guys were in high school, seriously, anything goes in high school.  Dude have you been in the bay recently?  It\\'s been cold as fuck.  Parts of the bay are literally freezing during the night.  Even though hell has already frozen over, Harbaugh won\\'t go to Texas.  I mean austin\\'s all nice and all but college football is small time regardless of the money.  it\\'s a pride thing.  Superbowl>5 BCS Championships.   I ain\\'t even mad because the Giants seem to limp into the playoffs every year and then wreck havoc across the land.  It\\'s not how you play in the regular season.  It\\'s not about seeding.  It\\'s about Catching Fire in the playoffs and how much you Hunger for the Game.  Yea i just did that, suck it.   Choke on a dick* Without USA backing and weapons and supplies, Japan would be demolished.  What the Japanese do have is a never give up, never surrender attitude which would only lead to the utter complete total annihilation of the Japanese people.  \\n\\nI can\\'t stress more on how absolutely devastatingly one sided this war with be.  Japan barely has a military without the USA backing it up.  The only reason no one attacks Japan is, well firstly because it would incite international ire and there really are no resources to exploit, but mainly because if you attack Japan, the USA responds.  The one on one war between the UK and Japan would be equivalent to Superman vs a 13 year old.   The most maddening part is that she thinks cocaine is a \"snort off the street\" type of drug.\\n\\nAlso, the last time SF had a republican/conservative mayor was in 1964 and what the fuck does tammy lasagna know about that SF?  Who asked for this? Jesus christ guys, it\\'s Holloway. By a really really really far margin, it\\'s Holloway.  It\\'s the same weight class... Depending on the dish, it is done differently.  With curries, you should ladle the curry over the rice (while keeping the shared curry pot in the middle of the table).  With other dishes like a simple chicken satay, you should eat it over rice.\\n\\nHowever, you should eat it however you like to eat it.  There aren\\'t any rules to eating it and whatever tastes best to you is what you should do.   The story is a quarter time travel, half romance, and quarter full awesome.   Correct me if I\\'m wrong but tap water is chemically the same as in H2O but that doesn\\'t account for minerals and general stuff in the water.  Water with more flouride is still chemically H2O but it\\'s H2O with more flouride.   How about the Aitu 4 from season 13?  They ran that shit till the end.  I\\'m not a huge fan of the goody two shoe-ness of the people in the Aitu 4 but they did dominate.   Ask her out to get a milkshake or whatever the fuck kids do these days.  \\n\\nWalk up to her like a fucking boss.  Go, \"Hey Julie or whatever the fuck your name is, lets go to wherever the fuck they sell milkshakes and lets get a fucking milkshake this Friday after school.  It\\'ll be fucking fun.\"  \\n\\nLike a boss.   Thank you, peckerwood is a very underused term and it feels very appropriate to describe white supremacists.  I just need to find the equivalent term for other racial supremacists who also suck.  I get what you\\'re saying, I know a lot of those kinds of racialists.  Those who say they aren\\'t racist but harbor internal racist thoughts such as \"races shouldn\\'t mix\" or \"Black people have a natural tendency towards violence\" total bullshit like that.  I feel that sometimes those types are worse than the outright racists because they are dishonest racists.  Your friend doesn\\'t seem like a racist (to be fair, I don\\'t know her at all) but she seems submissive to this guy.  I retract abandoning your friend as the first choice however you should keep that option entirely open.  You should open her eyes about his racist transgressions and that you don\\'t like him and that you do not want to be near him in any way.  If you are clear and firm with your statements, she can choose to either accept them or your friendship will have to take a pause.   Yea but the only way they got the movie deals was by writing a book.  So I don\\'t know why you\\'re having any issues.   What Flash could do is take away his helmet thing and make Juggernaut chase him until the big fucker gets so tired that Flash just runs around the world to build up speed and like hit him with a giant battering ram.  Or something of the sort.  Flash wins.   and also GODDAMMIT I second this.  Also stop worrying about illegality because no one gives a shit if a 15 year old gets faced.   No country can win a way without Allies.  The border of Mexico and Canada are too large to stop a potential invasion.  One on One, there is no chance for any country in the world against America but 190+ countries (6.7 billion people) vs 1 country (350 million people) is a wipeout.  However, lets say, America was able to cordon off certain cities as basepoints like New York as a base or the bay area as a base or Los Angeles as a base, America can drag out the war for a very very very long time.  This is not an easy fight for the rest ofthe world but the numbers are too overwhelming in US vs the rest of the world   Could you imagine any boxer lasting more than 5 minutes against DC?  \\n\\nWhoever truly believes that a heavweight boxer can even beat even a middleweight mma fighter in MMA is delusional. Even more delusional as the people who believed Conor could beat Floyd.  If the prosecutor has enough evidence showing that she was lying, she would be charged.  If they have even more evidence than that, she would be indicted and it will go to trial.  If they don\\'t think they have a case, she won\\'t be charged. \\n\\n\\n Depends on the writer.  Shit writers write shittily regardless of time.   I feel the same way. Ariel used to be good when he was raging against the machine but he has now become a part of the machine. Corporate Helwani sucks. Tony got an interim shot at the real title and a real shot at the interim title so somehow some way that shit works out to getting a shot at the title i think. Well.... there you go  No, he said mediocrity, not flat out amazing.  His head was already moving avoiding the second shot after the flash knockdown. Incredible. I\\'m totally a TJ nuthugger but even those who hate him have to appreciate him a little bit.  As a great man once said, \"Who the fuck is Dennis Siver?\" I am a God\\n\\nI am a God\\n\\nI am a God\\n\\n-Kanye West.  Touching me in general.  I\\'m sorry.  I\\'m weird.  I don\\'t like human contact unless pre-approved.  (There\\'s a whole form and contract thing.  Take a number, fam.)   First of all, stop with the Bo Burnham, put on some Marc Maron and listen to what good comedy is like.  Secondly, break up with your girlfriend, obviously, you are over her and you see no future with her.  Might as well not waste each other\\'s time.  Secondly, don\\'t pursue this girl.  She has a boyfriend.  If you think she loves you, she will tell you and make changes in her life but until she does, at best you will be a side piece.  Just get your life in order first.  Show her that she is more than a fling by breaking off with your girlfriend whom you don\\'t seem to like that much anyway.  Once you do that, the ball will be in her court and you will know if she loves you back.  As long as she\\'s with her boyfriend, she will never truly love you.  Any excuse she gives will sound real to you but in reality is bullshit.   This is entirely normal because at some point, every guy wishes he had hooked up with one of his exgf\\'s hot sister.  I think this is entirely normal but you need to figure out what you want and then pursue it.  If you want your boyfriend and love him, stay with him.  If you think your relationship with your bf is going nowhere, you should go after the brother.  To be honest, you must prepare for the onslaught of hate that may come but screw what these judgy people say and you do you.  Find what makes you happy and then go do that.   FUCK.  YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it stops things from sticking.  It doesn\\'t work all that well on a lot of stuff but it\\'s a thing.   Good for you!  I\\'m glad one of these stories worked out on reddit.  I was getting genuinely depressed there.  I don\\'t know whether or not your did the right thing (I think you did) but I hope it works out.  It seems like you really love this guy and to give him some credit, he didn\\'t throw some hissy fit about it.  He simply realized that it was ridiculous to make you throw away your best friend for him and he decided that he had to let you walk.  He wanted to spare you of having to make that choice.  I know in the end you did make a choice and you chose him but think about it from his point of view.  It\\'s massively unfair to ask your SO to give up their best friend because you are uncomfortable with it.  I really like what he did and I really like what you did and i really like how it works out in the end and i really like that there\\'s hope on reddit.  I think you two aren\\'t good for each other.  Just get joint custody and get out of a toxic sitch already.  You cheated (like a level 2 cheat) on him and then he retaliated and also cheated (more of a level 5 cheat).  If you both really loved each other, I\\'m not sure you would have cheated in the first place and if he really loved you, he definitely wouldn\\'t have retaliate cheated.  Plus, it seems like he wants to be with this lady (don\\'t slut shame, she\\'s an adulteress, you don\\'t know that she\\'s a slut.  Is she a bad person?  Maybe.  But she isn\\'t breaking any vows, your man is breaking the vow.)  more than he wants to be with you.  Do you want to fund my film?  I guarantee it will be a waste of money with no possible way to ever recoup the expenses.   So you\\'re telling me that the year I knew she was comiccon, I knew she was on the comiccon floor.  I scour the floor with my phone on reddit running up and down the San Diego convention center only to have my two hours of searching end in disappointment and nothingness and you\\'re telling me that you bumped into her on the subway?  \\n\\nMy life is pointless and meaningless and everything I do is for nothing.   You\\'ll change.  People change.  Maybe she\\'ll change.  It\\'s not like she wants kids now.  She wants kids later.  Who knows, maybe you want kids later maybe she\\'ll not want kids later.  Just let it ride.   She\\'s taking advantage of you and your grandmother\\'s initial kindness and she pushed you over the edge.  Next time she\\'s late with rent, don\\'t accept it.  Get a lawyer.  Character assassinate her in front of a judge.  \\n\\nLook, you\\'re always going to seem like the bad guy when you kick a pregnant woman out of your house.  Hell, she could probably murder your other roommates and you\\'d still seem like the bad guy but you gotta do what makes you happy.  Don\\'t bow down to her.  Tell her that she has to go or you will proceed to make her life a living hell. (Basically put things she needs on super high shelves.  The last thing a pregnant lady needs is to climb on a chair to reach stuff.   American is what you make of it.  If you live in America and want to be here, by all accounts, you\\'re an American.  Especially if you have citizenship or permanent residency.  Depends on how the fight goes. \\n\\nIf Kevin Lee goes in there and bodies Barboza and knocks him out in 2 minutes, he\\'ll be ahead of Poirier and behind Tony and Conor.  Shock factor might put him ahead and depends on the promo he cuts.\\n\\nIf he goes out there wrestles down Barboza and chokes him out in 2 minutes, he\\'ll be ahead of Poirier maybe? More iffy but I lean towards yes. \\n\\nIf it\\'s a 5 round wrestling domination or split decision war, maybe he gets over on Poirier but Poirier has never fought for a title and could be seen as fresh blood (despite being in the UFC for longer).  \\n\\nIf it\\'s a 5 round spllit decision borefest, then no.  \\n\\n\\nEither way, no matter what happens in *this* fight* (and this fight only, not counting injuries/court cases and suspensions) Kevin Lee will not be the #1 contender (whatever the fuck that means nowadays)\\n Keep on keepin on.  Don\\'t tell her, it can only end up badly.   The niners were using him as Vernon 0.5 Here\\'s a shocker, the cheese.  The wrong kind of cheese can destroy your burger.  Gotta be either American, swiss, or sharp cheddar for me.   uhhh, dude calm the fuck down.  She slapped you twice, deal with it.  You can argue that it is technically abuse but dude... c\\'mon.  Just calm down.   Cory Lemonier just outperformed him in the preseason.  We are stacked in the linebacker position and this way, Haralson can probably start for the Saints instead of being 4th string for the 9ers.   HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, your boyfriend masturbates once a month.  PLEASE!  He masturbatin\\'  oh he masturbatin\\'  This is the most correct answer. T Wood has essentially taken no significant damage in 5 title fights (3 of which went a full 25 minutes). That\\'s insanely impressive regardless of opponent.  I actually really like Pettis so I don\\'t want to see him take an L in that devastating of a fashion. \\n I used to scoff at the power of a name.  I am a child of immigrants so I know how funny sounding names are.  \\n\\nLet me come at this from a few different angles.\\n\\nFirst, from your mother\\'s view, she may view changing your name as a formal disassociation from her/your culture. That entire subject is rough because it took years for me to accept the importance my culture played in making me who I am.  If I were her, and I\\'m not so I\\'m talking out of my ass, I might misconstrue it as you being ashamed of your heritage.\\n\\nSecondly, from a micro view of it, it\\'s your name, you can do whatever you want.  People will be made but whatever makes you happy is what you should do.  If it makes you more comfortable and live a happier life, that\\'s your decision to make. \\n\\nFinally, the macro view it, aka my opinion as an outsider.  We live in a society where western cultures have won. They simply have.  The entire world uses a calendar based off western religions. We accepted western governmental and societal structures and so much of the uniqueness of cultures have been stripped away to this point.  The only thing that we have left is our names.  That name is symbolic of where you are from, where your ancestors and cultures are from.  These western names were forced upon people in the past, given no choice but to lose their past and their history to take on the name given by an oppressor.  It is why people like Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul Jabbar changed their names, to reclaim a little bit of what was once theirs.  So after all these people fought so hard to reclaim their names, why work so hard to give your name up?\\n\\nBut hey, that\\'s just my opinion, do what makes you happy.  This opens up a whole different discussion.  Skywriting isn\\'t native to LA so the question is, where are you moving from that had no skywriting before? Be prepared that your kids will grow up slightly racist if this issue is never addressed.  \\n\\nImagine if your kids were 50% Ann Coulter-ish.  Or basically like Greta Van Susteren.   Punter.  Duh.  When have you heard of a \"game winning punt\"?  Uhh, soon?  Definitely do it before you guys have sex and not like immediately before.  You should tell him that you are a virgin and then let him decide what to do.  As a guy, I wouldn\\'t really care except for the added pressure put on me.   Katy Mixon seems like a fun person to be around.  Is she as fun as her character on EB&D?? This is very helpful but I already abide by most of these rules. I always agonize over luxury items for a few days before I buy them (regardless of how low the price is) and a lot of times I\\'ve had to let things go. \\n\\nSeamaster, why didn\\'t I just buy you?!?!??!?!?\\n\\nBut yea, I was providing some flare and drama but I\\'m doing okay, I haven\\'t reached beyond my means forreals but I always respect people with a lot of restraint.  Hater\\'s gon hate.  Your fiance\\'s sister is a hater and she\\'s just gonna keep hatin.  Just continually be nice to her and be cordial and maybe someday she\\'ll change her mind.  Worst case scenario, everyone will think she\\'s a dick.  Win win although it\\'s hard to be nice to people who hate you.   you should call his baby Hank Carradine Kelvin was a state champion wrestling in AZ high schools. It\\'s not DC or Askren level but that\\'s not nothing. Brunson was D2 All American and couldn\\'t take Adesanya down.\\n\\nThe 1 of 9 takedowns from Gastelum is not important or maybe even a positive for Adesanya. This is an deep pull and I appreciate it.  My favorite part is when some random boxing coach in Colorado is like \"I don\\'t know why no one notices that Jon Jones has a lot of tendencies. We are going to capitalize on those.\" \\n\\nOh word? All of the top flight coaches in the world have faced Jon and none of them ever figured out what you, random dude in colorado, has figured out completely.  FOH On a technical note, in DC Jones II, most of DC\\'s best moments were in the clinch, landing the same type of punches that hurt Stipe. If we are to believe that DC\\'s power at heavyweight is much more significant than his power at LHW, i mean...... Jon really wanna test his chin? The drunk thing is one thing the homophobic thing is another.  If he was just a drunk, maybe you can deal with him, maybe he can seek help.  The homophobe thing is a whole different animal.  If I were you, I would cut off all contact with them and if your boyfriend doesn\\'t respect it, he\\'s done too.  Luckily, it seems like he respects your decision but it\\'s gonna be hard for you.  I say do what makes you happy, don\\'t try to be polite or be cordial if other people are insufferable assholes.   I\\'d probably go with Nova Uniao Look man, only thing you should listen to me about is when I say consult a professional. I\\'m just talking shit 98.9% of the time.  I constantly ask myself if I truly know what other people are dealing with.  The answer is always no.  But it\\'s a good reminder.  Before I do something shitty or be a total asshole to people, I ask myself, \"What is this person going through in their lives?\" and I always respond with \"I don\\'t know.\" so lets not be totally shitty.   Are you 12? Then let the friendship be over.  She has no right to emotionally blackmail you like this.  She has no right to make this demand.  You do what makes you comfortable and what is the best decision on YOU.  Remember, this is YOUR body, this is YOUR choice.  \\n\\nLay it out like this and if she doesn\\'t understand, she never deserved your friendship to start with.   So... you\\'re a rapist at worst and a sexual assaulter at best.  Congrats.   Kelvin hits accurately and hard as fuck but Bob took two bombs from Yoel Romero and didn\\'t go out cold. Like forreals, what can Kelvin really do to the ultimate boy Bob.  Philosophy: Why would you like fries with that? I do because mma is stupid and crazy and weirder shit has happened.  I also thought that at first too. Could you even imagine the slaughter? Firstly, her bad for lying to you in such an overboard fashion.  Hyperbole, dawg.\\n\\nSecondly, your bad for trying to change her. If smoking is such a deal breaker than break the deal.  Don\\'t get into a relationship expecting that you can make the other person change into something they\\'re not.  What if you love football and she came into the relationship and wants to you absolutely give up football.  You know you shouldn\\'t be wasting 3-9 hours a week sitting on your ass drinking beer and eating nachos but you love it and it\\'s a habit.  \\n\\n How about you try respecting her privacy and let her do what she wants? 1. Write a good query letter.  If your query is shit, no one will read your book.\\n\\n2. Agents ask for first 50 pages, if your first 50 pages are weak, the rest of your novel doesn\\'t even matter.\\n\\n3.  Don\\'t say it should probably be placed next to John Green, an author like him or Suzanne Collins are 1 in about 50 million.  You have to realize the harsh fact that your writing probably won\\'t be the next big hit.  I know you are saying that you are writing in the same genre as John Green but in a query letter, do not compare yourself to authors.\\n\\n4. Find the right agent (agents don\\'t have to be in your country).  Some agents don\\'t do YA and some specialize in it.  \\n\\n5. Query letter.  You can\\'t cold call agents or just send them emails saying you have a book.  Write the query to persuade them that you are serious about getting published.   yea but parts of oakland are better and parts of oakland are worse.  Lake merritt is in the \"better\" range homie.   My other favorite line was from Tyson. \"I don\\'t believe in anything.  Except magic.  Magic\\'s awesome.\"   And not in the good way.   I think not seeing Jon Jones fight regularly in the past few years made us think that everyone at 185 should move up. We\\'ll remember probably pretty quickly why Weidman, Rockhold, Romero, et al stay at 185 once Jon comes back.  Unlimited campaign donations to politicians.  How is it that bribery is now legal? it\\'s a chain in which the style, thickness, and shinyness makes the wearer look like a dickhead. LOL we don\\'t criticize Singapore anymore because our government is too stupid to understand what is and what is not Singapore.  lol I would also put DJ/Hume, Cyborg/Parillo, and an underrated Woodley/Din Thomas in consideration.

It\\'s weird that you are finding yourself less attractive even though it\\'s your girlfriend that\\'s gaining weight.  \\n\\nCheck yo grammar Guess kap couldn\\'t get him a deal on a new Jag This is heartbreaking.  I don\\'t judge you negatively for any of it at all.  Thanks for sharing and I hope you find happiness wherever it is from.   Amanda Nunes gets left out so much and deserves so much respect. If she beats Holly Holm she will have beaten every champ at 145, 135 and one of the two 125lb champs. And she knocked out cyborg in a round. Who the fuck does that??? Germany would be the douche nerd who is mean and only worries about doing ze homeverk.  \\n\\nUSA would be the quarterback jock.\\n\\nCanada would be the basketball player who is quite insightful but he always hangs out with USA and often gets grouped as a dumb jock.  \\n\\nFrance is the art student who is a little weird.\\n\\nItaly is the kid who will fuck your boyfriend/girlfriend when you aren\\'t there.  \\n\\n \"Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.

Also, unless it\\'s child pornography (under 18), i wouldn\\'t worry so much.  Porn doesn\\'t dictate what people will do.

Unless it is **child pornography**, I wouldn\\'t be worried about your daughter too much (worry a little though because you never know).

I thought I could develop a further connection with you but I am just not feeling an emotional connection nor do I feel the chemistry.

Again, it is my fault and I am sorry.\"  \\n\\nDo not mention the other woman unless you want a shit show.   Follow-up: Diaz took away his record? What record? Fuck no.  1. Red Forman.  Let\\'s be honest, Eric bagged Donna.  Donna.  C\\'mon guys, Bobby Hill is kinda weaksauce compared to Eric.\\n\\n2. Hank Hill.  Red hates people and neighbors.

Sometimes splits happen for the better.  Why spend time being marginally unhappy with a person for ever when you can break it off while you\\'re young?\\n\\nWith your mother, it sucks.  Really sucks but it\\'s something that happens to many people.  Treasure the time you had with her and the time you will have with her.\\n\\nWith your father and your sister, call them out for their dickiness.  You posted a picture, what the fuck are they flipping out about?  Tell them that she is your mother and they can\\'t threaten you in that way.\\n\\nWith your job, hang on to it as well you can.  Any reasonable boss would understand your situation but that does not give you any excuse to slack off.  Drown out everything else as well as possible and throw yourself into work.  It\\'s not exactly healthy but sometimes, it\\'s the best people can do.  Except it hasn\\'t Oh look, brendan is grasping at straws yet again That\\'s some scary shit. Damn....

Pre-orders should be available very soon.  Get hyped! Ask nicely if you can bring your SO to the wedding. If they say no, don\\'t go to the reception.  If they say yes, then have a fun time.  Or if they say no, go anyways.  Really, it\\'s only one night and it really doesn\\'t affect your life in anyway.   Also, if I remember correctly, that might have been the kick that missed by a mile.  uh... maybe being isolated from your closest friends and family and living on a god forsaken island for a month for money you\\'ve already won isn\\'t the most appealing thing in the world?

Sure gifts are nice and once in a while taking them out is great too but if that is what you\\'re basing a break up on, you are either going out with the wrong girl or think all girls are gold-diggers.  Women want men who can give them things like that but that shouldn\\'t be the most important thing they want.  \\n\\nI just don\\'t get why some men have this feeling of inadequacy.  If the girl loves you, she loves you for you, not your money.  God, I\\'m fucking pissed reading this.  All the muthafuckas like you have a good, no, great girlfriend who doesn\\'t care about your money and loves you and supports you and you throw it away because she has to pay for dinner when you go out.  Bitch, yes you are definitely a bitch, stop being such a goddamn pussy.  Fuck.  You\\'re such a bitch right now.  You know what, since you feel so fucking worthless, maybe you are worthless, dump your girlfriend.  She deserves better and by better, I don\\'t mean a guy who has money, I mean a guy who has enough self respect to not consider giving up on a girl like her.  \\n\\nI thought about being nice but your insecurity and inferiority complex is really pissing me off.  Have some fucking confidence you bitch ass pussy.  Think about this and say it out loud to your self.  \\n\\n\"My girlfriend loves me.  She supports me even though I am growing through a very hard financial time.  I don\\'t have any money and I live with my parents yet she still, for some reason that isn\\'t money, sticks with me through all of this.  You know what?  **lets dump the best thing I have in my life**\"\\n 5 days notice vs Khabib. Not taking that fight is just smart.

It will blow my \"don\\'t move up to a division that will get Jon Jones back\" hypothesis out of the water and I will love it.  Things you need to know:\\n\\n-You have reservations about Kaepernick, he seems like the savior some times and other times you wish he would stop goddamn throwing to Crabtree.  \\n\\n-Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, and Bill Walsh are god.\\n\\n-Roger Craig and Steve Young are supermen\\n\\n-Dwight Clark is somewhere in between.\\n\\n-Eddie D was totally unjustly removed from the league and belongs in the football hall of fame.\\n\\n-That fourth Super Bowl is technically Bill Walsh\\'s Super Bowl despite the fact that Seifert was the coach.\\n\\n-Jeff Garcia is an unsung hero that deserves more credit than he ever got.\\n\\n-Make up some justification for not drafting Aaron Rodgers over Alex Smith.\\n\\n-Patrick Willis and Navarro Bowman are America\\'s couple.\\n\\n-Candlestick Park is a shitty stadium but only we can say it\\'s shitty.  If a non Niners fan disrespects Candlestick, shit will need to go down.\\n\\n-Jim Harbaugh is new God.  Basically Jesus.

We go out and we punch them in the mouth.  We have talent all around but we play hard nose.  Finesse is good when called for, otherwise, in your face is how it goes.  \\n\\nEDIT: In my stupidity, I forgot to mention Ronnie Lott, baddest man on Earth.  Ronnie Lott is so badass, he chopped off part of his finger to continue on in the season.  Literally lopped off part of his finger.  An combine that with his unbelievable skill as a safety, he was probably the greatest safety of all time and one of the top defensive players in NFL history.  \\n Let us not forget that he also missed 185lbs.  No problem.  Continued education is really the key to realizing and fixing our latent racially charged misconceptions.  For example, people tend to think that black people have tendencies to be more violent than any other race and this is due to them being African American.  However, if you look deeper, you\\'ll see that while poor African Americans tend to commit more crimes than poor white Americans, middle income black people commit crimes on the same frequency as middle income white people.  So the real issue of crime isn\\'t a race issue, it\\'s a income issue (it sounds duh! when you say it because rich people aren\\'t robbing 7/11s, poor people are).  Now that you know that crime is an income issue, you start fixing it from there instead of trying to fix crime as a race issue. \\n\\nSo what do you do?\\n\\nWell, we know that people who finish high school tend to have a higher income than those who don\\'t and those who finish college tend to have a higher income than high school graduates.  So now you have to keep poor people in school and how do you help poor people finish high school?  Better teachers, revamping of school fundings, more money towards the schools to have smaller class sizes so that teachers can actually connect to students, and a plethora of other things.  Then the next step would be helping poor people graduate college.  Well, financial aid and lower rated loans and lower costs to go to college would help poor people afford going to school for higher education.  \\n\\nThese are just some ways looking at facts and using logic can deter your racially charged thoughts and then help you try to find a solution to the problems in this country.  The example I gave is by no means the absolute correct way, hell, the stuff about the education is just my opinion of how our school systems could be fixed.  However, the conclusion I came to is what\\'s important to take away.  When you have a feeling, think about why you think that way.  Do your research and then see if you were right or wrong.   That, my guy, is that good good sweet sweet panic wrestling.  Just leave him already.  There are guys out there that won\\'t cheat on you (shocker, i know).

The car was an older early 2000\\'s mustang and the headlights weren\\'t super strong. The road is usually empty as shit but because I drive like a grandma, I usually drive slowly anyway. \\n\\nThat night was different though so I was bombing the fuck down the hill cuz I really just wanted to get home and sleep. I get to this point where I hit this turn and this girl was just standing on the side of the road waiting to pass so I slam on the brakes super hard (shitty brakes too) and come to a full stop like 25-30 feet before where the girl was trying to cross. \\n\\nI gestured for her to go but she never looked my way at all and after a few minutes of her standing there like a moron, I drove past her. I saw in my rear view later her walking into the middle of the street and then turn to look at me and I was ready to get out the car and be like \"Fuck you lookin at, you don\\'t want this smoke\" but I\\'m a giant wuss and also wasn\\'t gonna fight a girl. \\n\\nUpon getting home, I realized something I didn\\'t at the moment because I was just so appalled that she didn\\'t cross when I slammed on the brakes just to let her cross. The road had nothing to the right and nothing to the left of it. No houses, nothing. it was a dirt hill to the right and a cliff down the hill to the left. Where the fuck did this girl come from?? The why is easy. Sports matter to sports fans like myself. We have attachments to these athletes and to these teams and feel genuine (and stupid) pain when bad things happen to them.

Just realized that I put on some Presto or Ragu in it, it would\\'ve elevated that shit to a new level and made it essentially a real deal hotpocket.  Absolutely overlooked because he isn\\'t getting the title shot despite kicking and punching Anthony Smith into next week. \\n\\nI\\'m tellin y\\'all, I\\'m dying with this hot ass take that Thiago Santos is the only 205er that can beat Jon.

I started climbing in the Bay Area at a gym in Hollywood Boulder\\'s network but if there are other gyms in LA that are as good or better, I\\'d love to try. Thanks! Breh, I didn\\'t even go mention Kanye\\'s body of work yet because he went full MAGA but let\\'s be real, Gold Digger, All Falls Down, Paris all have more famous hooks than Forgot About Dre Kneeling in front of burning flags.

It is very possible to get a cheap and reliable car for 3K or less in LA. However, it takes some searching and being extremely careful in making sure the car is in good condition. If you make sure to have your (and I stress that it\\'s your) mechanic do a pre-purchase inspection before buying to check for rust, frame damage, and any other potentially super big issues. \\n\\nYour choice of vehicle, of course, will be limited.

Low center of gravity my G.  There are like 3 people on the planet that might get out if they are locked in room with DC and best be sure that none of them are boxers.  Even if you dedicated years to wrestling, the gap is so far, a top tier boxer would never be able to catch up to DC. \\n\\nShit, Conor McGregor is fucking good at defending a takedown and even his gap against Khabib was so severe that Khabib dominated him. How can anyone think that a top tier boxer could \"probably pick up enough wrestling and bjj to completely dominate\"?\\n\\n He wrestled at 55kg so i\\'m sure he was probably the average height.  Honestly don\\'t understand how any human being can be that tough. I bump my shin lightly against my coffee table and I\\'m calling in sick and need 4 days of bedrest. These motherfucking professional goddamn fighters get kicks checked and continue fighting like nothing happened.  dat badonkadonk tho... Even the lowest count, it\\'s still absolutely crazy.

I step in UFC building like I\\'m the shit\\n\\nTell \\'em, \"Give me fifty million now or I\\'mma quit\" I want to preface this by saying that I actually enjoy the work that Ariel, Megan, and Karyn do. I think Karyn Bryant is a really good broadcaster and glad she\\'s getting some NFL Sunday work.  \\n\\nThat being said, all sides are in the wrong as journalists because they all took money from the UFC. If you take money from the people you are supposedly holding in check, you\\'re not a journalist, you\\'re a PR person. That doesn\\'t discount the work they do as broadcasters or interviewers.

Look man, maybe Anthony Pettis didn\\'t become the greatest fighter like he was supposed to but that dude has always been tough as fuck, game as fuck, fought everyone, and has some super exciting moments and fights. Good on Pretty Tony.  Someone is going to get hit by an asteroid. Watch.  *if age finally catches Romero*\\n\\nI say we reserve making outlandish assumptions such as \"people age\" until we see evidence that Yoel Romero is 1. people and 2. susceptible to aging.  When Showtime was Showtime.  Guys, don\\'t worry. This isn\\'t Khabib and Tony. This fight isn\\'t hella cursed.  I hold back, sometimes I won\\'t, yuh Paid. Thanks! Daaamn One random spot please! Brian Ortega vs Khabib is a fight that does things to me. Adult things.  Didn\\'t cut weight at all and STILL put on 4 more pounds since weigh ins. My hero.  \"dilutes the importance of titles\" lol they\\'ve made 800 interim titles but the 165lb division will be the one thing that ruins the sanctity of belts.  Hampage Jackson man... jesus christ.  I support all of this.  I love this poster.  Look at the original question. Also, again, if the point of defense is to not get hit and to not take damage, Tyron Woodley hasn\\'t been hit or taken damage in his last 5 championship fights.  Fights outside of the UFC are not amateur fights......... He trains a lot at ATT Evolution in St. Louis, not the main location in Coconut Creek.  Kid Yamamoto was the man.  In a Post-DC world, he could probably contend and get to the point where he can get brutalized by Jon Jones.  T Wood has so many side hustles, he\\'s the one dude I\\'m not worried about post-fight career. He\\'s gonna be on our screens for a long long time.  Song is gonna be baaad but it\\'s okay. He\\'s out here living his best life.  Shit, I\\'d even be down if he produced Champ Camp for other people. I\\'d love to see what goes on really behind the scenes on other high level fighters.  You do you and save up that paper. I wish i had the mental fortitude to not spend money like a mad man. Shit I\\'m glad I saw this because I have a wild dickhead chain in my cart on another tab and was about to buy it but now I think I should reconsider. \\n\\n Paid! Thanks! If you\\'re asking that question, you already don\\'t get it, my g.  57 please!  I\\'m not gonna get it until my next check. Right now I gotta hit the savings for it so I\\'m doing the responsible thing and waiting. Because grown up shit.  I don\\'t make that kinda skrill homie.  They are like everyone else. There are cool muslims, weird muslims, chill muslims, bitch ass muslims, muslims that are hella cool and you want to be their friend but are afraid to come on too strong, muslims you wish would stop calling you, muslims you want to date, muslims you want to ghost, muslims who are super religious, muslims who are not religious at all, muslims that are single, muslims that are married, muslims that have children, and muslims that don\\'t. \\n\\nThey are people at the end of the day and, at the core of it all, they want a roof over their heads, a square meal, and for their kids to have the same opportunity as any other kid.  Funny thing, Stefan Struve is the one fighter that showcases that reach is not an advantage.  \\n\\nFor examples of reach being an advantage, look at Kevin Lee\\'s fight with Barboza. After Barboza catches him with that spinning kick, Lee, in his whobbliest state, is able to grab Barboza and wrap his hands completely around him. \\n\\nReach isn\\'t just about striking, it\\'s also part of grappling.  Tag I kinda miss fat(ter) dana.  Thanks!  62 Please!  I had the same feelings. Slow mo jiggle.  tag please! Tag thanks! Not you. OP.

Thannnnnnks! 1 random slot please.  Tag Ehhhh, I wouldn\\'t change what I did. College was pivotal in shaping who I am and getting out of my town and situation. I could be making more money but I\\'m making enough to not worry and in that, I can search for whatever solace or happiness I need. Student debt is student debt, we\\'re all struggling through it.  And Eddie Alvarez. All straight up killers. Who does Cliff Paul fight? I know right? 17k saved up at 27 years old? I\\'m roughly the same age and I have 100k in student debt so I\\'m really at -95k in net worth.  \\n\\n\"I should be owning my own private jet.\" Yea, well I should be the heavyweight champion of the world and a 5 time NBA champion. Dawg, mediocre to you is what people call normal life. \\n\\nI think that you\\'ll find that when you get the PJ and the penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park, you\\'re still not going to be happy. \\n\\nBut then again, being sad on the PJ is better than being sad in coach.  I have no real evidence and I\\'m just a salty hater but I think Matt Hughes gets washed in today\\'s UFC. Yoel Romero\\'s boxing is super underrated.  I mean, I know Pretty Tony Pettis is not a JacksonWink fighter but I do remember Cowboy helping out him out during his camp for Barboza. \\n\\n I think it\\'s more of a question of whether or not the head flies out of the cage or not.  Not being able to point out John McCains very real and legitimate shortcomings just because he died recently. \\n\\nFor whatever man he was, he had many policy decisions that caused the harm and death of countless people. We should be allowed to critique him in his entirety and not just the good shit he did.  Shout out to Uncle Luke.  war lineker I\\'ll make it easier for you. **KNOCKS ON WOOD BEFORE TYPING THIS**\\n\\nKhabib gets injured and pulls out. Tony vs Conor gets booked.  Tony trips on another cable at Fox Studios but this time in New York and destroys his other knee. Showtime vs Conor for Interim 155 belt. \\n\\nAlthough what\\'s more likely is Conor throws a shopping cart through a Russian liquor store, gets pulled form the card.  Khabib vs Tony is booked and because that fight is hella cursed, Khabib gets hit by an asteroid and then Tony vs Showtime for the interim 155 lb as the main event.  \\n Pretty Tony vs Weird Tony.  It\\'ll only take a couple hundred mil to start anything that will reach anywhere near the Bellator level so if you got that trust fund, have at it.  It\\'s not about winning, it\\'s about looking pretty while you fight.  Forreals, why do people think it\\'s easy when Bellator, with giant established money backing it, is still struggling. It is a miracle the UFC got to where it is.  The injuries really took away a lot of his athletic pop and then the lack of tune-up fights in MMA had him fight RDA, Eddie Alvarez and Edson back to back to back. Should\\'ve fed him some nub after the RDA loss just to get him back on track.  Grappling Industries has a smaller one coming up and Subfighter BJJ is always available as well.  MMA has always had it\\'s tie to the WWE and pro-wrestling. \\n\\nAlso, they are Prize Fighters, they fight for money, the whole point is to make money. The fighter you\\'re speaking of are either from the movies or at a 500 record and 89 fights in having made zero name for themselves. \\n\\nAlso the Anderson Silva era and the Tito Ortiz era are, for the most part, different eras. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen McGregor and Brock retire, they will have another batch of stars that might not be as big but will still make them money.  And then there will be another batch. And another batch. And at some point, there will be a fighter that comes along who will be bigger than McGregor.  \\n\\n At the time, we didn\\'t know but now we know that Whittaker has a monster chin and Wolverine speed of recovery so Brunson was essentially going to lose this fight 10 times out of 10.  Oh, you don\\'t like your promoters out here bashing his own champions?  Fucking.  the Mustang from Bullitt. My personal fave.  Selling a Meistersinger Neo NE201g for $250 OBO. If picked up in Los Angeles, it will be $225. \\n\\nIt\\'s in pretty good condition but the face shows wear and tear as well as the band. It\\'s been a solid watch and versatile to my outfits but it\\'s time for an upgrade.  Runs perfectly fine, never had any problems with it. Owned it for about a year.  Goddammit I love Mighty Mouse. Bingo.  Boxing cardio is nothing to fuck with.... I use the UFC official rankings to remind myself of a few things:\\n1. if a fighter is still in the ufc/mma at all\\n2. what weight class up and coming names are in\\n3. a good laugh for when Jon Jones comes back and automatically vaulted back up the P4P list.  DC last fought in February. It\\'s been 6 months. Chill.  Curtis Blaydes is dat fukin dude tho. Stipe can win but that\\'s a big risk.  Race relations are not at their worst in America right now.... I\\'m not sure if you know this but we had Black people as slaves and also Japanese internment and also mass deportations of Chinese people oh and this little thing where multiple groups of Natives Americans were killed in one of the worst genocides in history.  It\\'s actually pretty good right now.  Goddammit I still love Fit Tony. Hope he gets back on track, maybe make one last run for the title (or at least some fun fights with big names) TJ left TAM out of loyalty for Duane. They are one of the best coach fighter combos in UFC history.  And they would both have read the words \"one of the best\" HEAD MOVEMENT HEAD MOVEMENT Cody did say he would die for TAM so... i mean.... after all the shit he talked, he just gotta stick with Faber.  Didn\\'t realize this but goddamn! Cody ain\\'t doin it at 145. He got a better chance killing himself to get to 125. I mean... \"fires shots\" in the most Stipe way possible.  How do you know this? Because TJ trains with a few high profile fighters and they all seem to like him. The only people who have said this are TAM people.  TG at TJ\\'s and a Very Cody Christmas.  \\n\\nTHIS SHIT WRITES ITSELF! Again, i get it, different title reign, but TJ did defend the belt twice at that point (now three times) I\\'ll watch Curtis Blaydes fight anyone tbh Goddamn. You right. I was high as shit when I typed it but damn, i\\'m ashamed. Good catch.  TJ is just too goddamn good. Love his fighting style, never a dull fight, never stops improving.  Pyramids of Giza. Especially if I can go inside. Even if it\\'s hella cursed. With my current job, I sent out my resume 4 times and got 2 interviews.  This is not normal though. The job before last, I must\\'ve sent out my resume 500 (not hyperbole) times and got maybe 10-15 interviews that resulted in about 3-4 offers. However, that job was my second job in my industry which is difficult to break into but once you\\'re in, it\\'s pretty easy to stay in.  Crave Cafe has multiple locations and they are all 24 hours.  Are we gonna act like they weren\\'t going to stand them up for the next round? That the beginning of the round would be on the ground? Cuz Eddie fans was are acting like he was 100% going to win if Goddard didn\\'t stand him up. All I saw is that the next moment they stand up, Poirier would\\'ve done what he did 80% of the time.  It really wasn\\'t. Woodley Wonderboy 1 was the same fight as the 2nd. Nothing nothing nothing big knockdown nothing vs nothing nothing nothing nothing big knockdown.  And if you need a friend to pick you up, I\\'ll be around\\n\\nAnd we can ride with the windows down, the music loud\\n\\nI can tell you ain\\'t laughed in a while\\n\\nBut I wanna see that crooked smile Color is weird on this one. Maybe color corrected since the live broadcast.  We really putting that much respect on Diego Brandao now? For all his country, Brazil? Please do that. *grabs popcorn* \"lack of power\" \\n\\n**Checks record**\\n\\n4 of last 5 wins ended in 1st round knockout. \\n\\nSeems right.  In our attempt to be smart, we\\'re making the world uninhabitable for ourselves so it is a bit difficult to be even dumber than that.  Dude broke into my house while I was inside. Only had a box cutter so I knew I would be okay for the most part. Tried to talk him down didn\\'t really work but all ended up okay.  a cigarette. lol no.  Eh. I\\'m sure that hand broke before. Fighters are tough as fuck, they\\'ll club you with a broken hand no problem.  Right now at this very moment it\\'s hard not to be a fan of Daniel Cormier.  tell them they\\'re wrong and that if they keep talking, they can catch deez handz. novelty snacks are name brand (cheese its) everything else is generic.  it\\'s weird but you should still do it.  Disney is good. Disney on ice is better. Roller skating is aight. Ice skating is better.\\n\\nThis logic checks out. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is mandatory. obviously it\\'s fencing and MMA.  I fell off my bed and my knee went straight into some legos. Had pretty deep cuts that took a shockingly long time to heal.  You\\'re not getting my password retrieval answers.  Again to reiterate, this is a great idea and really well thought out and I wish it were real.  Friendship is a two way thing. It can\\'t just be you making peace. Also, sometimes friends are toxic and you have to cut them out. Move on, give people space. If you guys care about each other, it won\\'t matter down the line.  It\\'s ok if you\\'re saying this to a close friend, a student, or your child. Otherwise, mind your own business.  It\\'s called huawei son.  Do ya step! \\nYou can do it all by yo\\' self! \\nLet me see you do it! Ay! So you are applying your experience with one person to an entire group of people. I wonder if there\\'s a word for that.... The fact that I\\'m not in the NBA.  The LA Metro system is safe and shockingly clean. I wouldn\\'t be too concerned (just aware), it\\'s nowhere near as gross as BART up in the bay or NY Subways.  And don\\'t forget the 14k gold chain. Most important part.  great minds think alike. Nothing like fashion mixed with comfort when I\\'m racketeering.  I was just about to say. The Adidas tracksuit all day.  \"We\\'ll all have healthcare in the future!\" WE WERE ON A BREAK!! I mean... Georgia is on the east coast but i get what you mean.  T.I. is the greatest don\\'t @ me. Other people got too good and I got too bad.  120k in Venice, 150k in MDR sound about right? I got crossed over pretty bad the last time I was playing basketball. I\\'m pretty bad all around and it\\'s always bordering on embarrassing.  A good smirk.  Write\\\\-in candidates [This one](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3UYJvASLVfFDO/giphy.gif) So. Much. Blow.  When I was 14, my parents put me on a fifteen hour flight with just my 13 year old friend and I to China. It was 1 stop in South Korea. I would have been worried sick.  Bruh it just takes time.  Shit can hurt for a really long time and you think about it less and less every day.  One day, you\\'ll find yourself a noticeably less angry.  A while later, you\\'ll find yourself even less angry.  And so on and so on.  \\n\\nWay I get through it is to tell myself that this will pass in time.   16 months or so in? Either exactly in the same place or a tiny bit better due to the lack of unnecessary tariffs placed against China.  That path we\\'re leading down currently is way worse and the brunt of the impact will hit 3/4 years down the line.   Trump\\'s recently implemented tariffs targeted Chinese steel.  Some of his predecessors have done this before. Let\\'s take George W. Bush who had similarly placed a tariff on Chinese steel.  This led to a boost in the overall price of steel worldwide and ended up costing about 200,000 U.S. jobs.\\n\\nMaybe unnecessary wasn\\'t the right word, stupid and irresponsible are more correct.  If your goal is to cause hundreds of thousands of Americans to lose their jobs, than the tariffs are absolutely necessary.  \\n\\n\\n\\n Pickles.  Onions.  Some olives.  Bell peppers.  I was a little shit when I was a kid but now i generally eat everything.  Overpopulation would be an even realer issue.  This guys knows.  Mixing and mastering works miracles. Vanderbilt\\'s. Rothschild\\'s.  Koch\\'s.  Walton\\'s. Du Ponts. Formerly the Rockefellers but now they washed.  I\\'m not going to summarize it until you do just one simple thing from the posterior.  Nope. Some are aspiring musicians, authors, artists, models, designers, in between jobs, or aspiring restauranteurs. There are a lot of food service workers in the Hollywood area and they are generally not much of a homogenous group.  Do I actually have to finish it? Like if I got 100k as long as I gave a valiant effort, I would but if the stipulation is that I had to finish an entire horse, I probably physically couldn\\'t.  I\\'d for sure try though. No, I\\'m fine.  mac n cheese.  I\\'m a sucker for nostalgia.

My point is SwedishCamping is correct.  Our corporate politburo gives us a choice of 2 similar candidates while even goddamn China gives an option of 4-5 similar candidates.  We\\'re a corporate oligarchy more than we are a democracy.   7 with moments of immense delusions of grandeur that bump me up to a 19.  The fantastic four remake.  They\\'d be shocked to learn that I don\\'t know how to fighting invading imperialist forces and successfully build an isolated, communist utopia that eventually falls into a oligarchy crony capitalist hellscape.   I was about 9 years old.  It was a simple fried rice.   I train with a dude who has about 8 fights in the UFC.  Won some lost some.  Super nice guy, helpful, and strong as a goddamn minotaur.  I think you think the UFC is a meritocracy. The UFC, from all past evidence, seems to believe Kevin Lee is more marketable than Dustin Poirier. If he wins spectacularly (despite missing weight) he will supplant Dustin Poirier.  \\n\\nDon\\'t be distracted by who is more \"deserving\" Your wife is right. You should just disengage and if they begin venting, tell them this is not your problem.  You are not responsible for two grown ass adult\\'s drama and should not be treated as such.  \\n\\n Tell your siblings to disengage as well.  United front or whatever.  Make them work it out themselves. Pulled herself from nothing.  Is incredible honest about her life whether it is good or bad.  Doesn\\'t shy away from anyone.  Plus Bodak Yellow slaps super hard and her part in No Limit was the shit.  Any one of those 2 minute Thai life insurance commercials.  Goddammit, the dad just wanted to take care of his daughter and she was so ashamed he was poor and deaf but even though she harbored resentment, he didn\\'t care because she was his little girl.  TEARS.  second place has to be \"What are you having?\" (said by bartender) Cardi B.  One time, a dude broke into my apartment while I and a cleaning lady was there.  He threatened to kill both of us.  He only had a box cutter so I knew I was gonna be aight.  I got both my cleaning lady and myself to a safe place before getting the proper authorities to handle it.  \\n\\nIt\\'s a very detailed and long story that I have told every woman I have ever met.  Ever.  It\\'s my favorite story.   cauliflower ear.  I have an insane amount of unearned/semi-earned confidence.  You\\'d be amazed.  The lack of conformity will always be polarizing.  He refuses to make pop-friendly hits yet somehow finds his way onto airwaves.  Not having the most fire features on an album to grab a larger audience.  Talking about super heavy subjects to beats that really knock.  \\n\\nHe\\'s just a weird dude and people who don\\'t know really what to feel and when people are confused, they make rash, generalized statements.  \\n\\nI love what he does but I can totally see why some people don\\'t.   If you\\'re doing it for a girl. Yes. \\n\\nIf you\\'re doing it to play touch butt with your stupid friends i the park. Don\\'t.   When someone caught the cash me ousside girl outside and she lived up to her name throwing smoke. It was amazing.  18-39 Ever heard of wrist control to kimura to mounted triangle? You\\'d think.....  Loud, obnoxious but funny more often than not. Daring, sometimes unsuccessful but sometimes highly successful sense of fashion.  Holy fuck is he loud though.

Didn\\'t care for the console but the controller was A+ When I was 11 or 12, I was practicing on the basketball court in our driveway.  Not a great shot but getting better.  Ball rolled down the driveway and my grandfather stopped his gardening and picked up the ball and proceeded to rain consecutive 3\\'s nonstop.  \\n\\nThat is when I gave up on my dream.  All of my dreams.  It\\'s fun until you get fined for loitering.  Healthy normal relationships because dat shit be boring. -8000000% Zero.

This fucking sucks. I don\\'t now but I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve never lost a job or an opportunity just because I\\'m Asian.  It\\'s not even on my mind most of the time.  \\n\\nTo have that hanging over you and knowing it\\'s be statistically shown to be true? What does that do to the psyche of Black Americans?  To know that you can accomplish as much as possible just to have people look at you in your face, tell you you\\'re good enough, and then reject you based on the color of your skin.  \\n\\nSource: http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/15/jalen-ross/black-name-resume-50-percent-less-likely-get-respo/ I\\'m Asian, I dress in streetwear at work all the time, have tattoos, listen to all sorts of ratch ass hip hop and get no shit for it.  Cops never stop me.  No one ever gives me problems.  It\\'s a different standard black people and latinos live by.  I can wear anything and I won\\'t be treated like a criminal.   That is quite literally word for word the point of what I said but whatever, if you want to disagree to agree that\\'s ok. We\\'re on the same side of this issue.  But the seed part of it is also annoying. It\\'s annoying on top of annoying but so good.  That is correct but I also wanted to highlight that Black Americans have a specific experience different from that of Black people in other countries.  Should\\'ve worded it better.

I wouldn\\'t give myself that much credit. This is just to not feel like an asshole, I really really really don\\'t want to give it back.  Also posted on Craigslist.  \\n\\nLet\\'s be real, this is only for my conscience, i don\\'t actually want to give it back.  Deal.  Omg, bingo! You got it 100% right. Okay, this part I actually need credit, I went up and down the street trying to see if anyone lost it and literally none of the shops/stores were open.  The one person that was inside their store shooed me away probably because I was looking haggard. Everything you do now will land you in big boy real jail. Tread lightly.

Their job isn\\'t to make the world a better place.  Some companies happen to make money by making the world a better place but if it came down to it, the goal is making money.  \\n\\nGiven that truth, most companies have skeletons.  It doesn\\'t mean to boycott life, all it means is to be a little bit more aware and, when financially and/or logistically possible, buy local.  A box of Irish junk food including the Mars Bars they have in europe.  Apparently it\\'s different and I can confirm it is delicious. Perch is the only one that comes to mind for me.  I would\\'ve also included cities in South Korea and in China.  All around it\\'s pretty safe, most crimes are petty theft or public intoxication (which I may or may not have had an issue with in China).   UFC is still the best promotion by a far margin. However, Scott Coker does way more with way less in talent.   If I never aged from this point off and Lebron gets to a point where he\\'s bed-bound and not a magical human like Kareem Abdul Jabbar, then maybe I have a shot.  Facts.  That whole thing where they\\'re genuinely interested and care about what goes in my life so they ask questions. Like bro, just leave me alone and stop being loving and caring. Assholes.   Look, you ahve kids now. Priorities are different since it\\'s not just you.  Not sure what it is exactly but do what\\'s right for your kids.  They aren\\'t able to stop you from doing anything but breh.... owe 350k and no job? That travel money ain\\'t your money, fam.  350k tho damn.

Getting money out of political campaigns. There is no more mature/appropriate answer than this. Pretty clear she didn\\'t think you were just FWBs.  In a more recent case: Killmonger.  Hard to come to the realization that the world you are experiencing, in the epoch that is your life, is relatively meaningless.  These are not the same people you will be with for the rest of your life.  None of it really matters even though it hurts so much in that very moment.  \\n\\nCan\\'t say don\\'t let it get to you because it will.  Can\\'t say ignore it because it\\'s so in your face.

Argo, saw it once, enjoyed it, will never see it again.  Moonlight, amazing movie, saw it once, will never see it again.  The Artist was a revelation but watching it second time is not a revelation, it\\'s a repeat.  Where do I even start? Let\\'s just go best picture winners in the last 20 years that I DO care about: Gladiator, The Departed.  That\\'s it.  \\n\\nAward movies are a genre unto themselves.

Not a super hardcore gambler so numbers aren\\'t astronomical.  Most I\\'ve ever lost was about 450 at the poker table on a 1/2 game. Trip kings and I lose to a bullshit 8 high straight.  Like How Sway?? Who goes in hard pre-flop on a 6 & 4??  \\n\\nBest pick up was a 850 win off of a bullshit, super luck 7 game parlay.  I only put down like 40 dollars or something and hit on every single pick. \\n\\n\\n\\n It\\'s a trap! Spoilers be a motherfucker.  Biochemist? I actually have no idea.   ok. Ok, you do you. Ok, colonizer.  *deep sigh*\\n\\nyou do you.  \\n\\nAlso, not that it matters but not a sister, breh.  Totally didn\\'t get the point but whatever, you do you.  If it\\'s fat, sugar is always the key.  If it\\'s muscle, lots of lifting and all sorts of supplements including but not limited to protein powder and creatine.  Just because there are more important issues doesn\\'t mean we should completely ignore it.  I get that a cut on your hand is nothing compared to cancer but you still bandage up your hand. We\\'re humans, we have the capacity to do more than one thing at a time.   The Luck of the Fryish and also Jurassic Bark but also The Sting.

Sometime\\'s I\\'m rational, sometimes I\\'m not. Depends on the situation, depends on the decision, depends on the day in which I make the decision.  What are you talking about? Downtown has been busier than it\\'s ever been.  I hate DTLA because it\\'s always crowded and parking is expensive as balls.  \\n\\nEverywhere other than Tokyo and Hong Kong are abandoned ghost town versions of New York. New York is the most populated city in the country and in a pretty small area, it\\'s always going to be filled with more people than any other American city.  \\n\\n All Day - Kanye. Dope song, lot of n-words in it. Can\\'t say that shit and no desire to.  The best case scenario for the \"good guy with a gun\" is that at minimum one innocent person gets shot.  In the most recent case in Texas, the good guy with a gun was able to cap the carnage off at 26 dead which is only one of the worst mass shootings in American history.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been to countries where guns are banned. It\\'s quite nice.  Walking around knowing that even if you get mugged, the mugger doesn\\'t have a gun is a pretty good feeling.  Also not dying is a pretty solid feeling either.  TI once told me I was awesome after I drunkenly told him he was awesome.  how good are you at the sport you\\'re good at. Cuz if you\\'re transcendent and can make millions then go with that. When you\\'re Lebron, you can make new Lebron worthy friend.s  both.  That went 0 - 100 real real fucking quick...... \\n\\nThat\\'s so not the best way to do it. Like, you go from misdemeanor scam to full on felony.  Just be like \"You owe a fee.\" why go all the  way to \"We have hostages.\" so quick? You\\'re equating discrimination and exploitation with upsetting someone and hurting their feelings.  It is possible to do something on a large scale and not discriminate and exploit. We just haven\\'t put the effort into doing it nor do the mass public care as long as it doesn\\'t affect them.   I find people who is caring to be super attractive. Kobe.  When he was playing I thought he was better than Jordan. Now I feel like he\\'s probably top 10 all time, maybe not even top 5.  Giants were not Brooklyn. They were Manhattan.  Also the 210 poster is just ripped from UFC 158.  Politician.  Thank god someone said it. Unwanted physical contact. It\\'s mad uncomfortable especially when you\\'re around other people and someone random just comes up all over you.  This usually comes with an unbelievable amount of alcohol.  Over population and unknown psychological effects but damn, lebron would be king forever.  I would refer to the great Judo Dan Kelly.    \\n\\nAlso, I\\'d supplement it with jiu jitsu and other grappling if you really want to be able have a full time job in mma training. Sometimes even if they are attractive but mad wasted, I don\\'t need no troubles homie. Back away.  Secondary tip is to never lose sight of your passport and to never hand it to anyone unless absolutely necessary (i.e. only at airports)  \\n\\nYou never know about local police (anywhere, including \"western\" countries) and your passport is your key to getting home.  Know where your embassy is located and if possible, stay at a hotel/hostel/airbnb closeby.  \\n\\nIt has never been relevant to my travels but it calms my mind knowing that I can physically run to the American consulate in case shit goes down.  Jewelry. That\\'s about it.  I mean... the problem is solved. The rich won and will continue winning. Poor have the numbers on them but the rich have evry other advantage.  New spot and new whip.  I\\'m like 6 months away from upgrading my  life so it\\'s almost there but I\\'m not too stressed.  The first ever lie.  You shouldn\\'t base relationships on having shit to do together. 5, 10, 20 years down the line, you\\'re gonna run out of shit to do.  It\\'s more about whether or not you can stand being around a person when there\\'s nothing to do.  This is all normal. You\\'re 19. Statistically speaking, it wasn\\'t going to last anyway.  I would break it off and discover a whole new world.  You can\\'t put that responsibility on you. It\\'s not your job to make sure someone else doesn\\'t fall apart.  You can be there to help but it isn\\'t your responsibility. Disgusting and derogatory comments about women might be what\\'s leading to failed relationships.  You can\\'t save them all.  THROW AWAY THE XXXL TALL TEE I have a discogs credit on an iTunes top album of 2016. SHE SMASHED THE HOMIE Maybe because I was jetlagged and starving but it felt like it took forever. I enjoyed a lot of it though. Harrison Ford had a great performance and Ana De Armas absolutely killed it\\n Get a crips rack straight from Wells Fargo and make it rain on his broke ass. \\n\\nHis kids are not him and you can help with his children without  having to flow money through him.\\n\\nAs with him getting violent, make sure he finds out in a public place with people around and also, be very careful. That shit is nothing to fuck with.  Your dad is being a dick about it but that drive isn\\'t that bad and a grown ass human should be able to do it.  I don\\'t get why he\\'s so adamant and being so difficult, that\\'s uncalled for.\\n\\nThen again, part of me gets it. The drive isn\\'t tough.  It\\'s just not.  Breh, I drove from SF to San Diego when I was 19, it\\'s not that hard. \\n\\nI mean, again, your dad is a total dick but damn son, the actual drive isn\\'t that bad.  Blade Runner 2049. It was a lot of time.  Good. But a lot of time.  No, they probably shut you down but they won\\'t fine you but for the most part, if you play it smart and lie, they won\\'t even stop you.  Try deeper in the SGV.  West Covina, Monrovia, etc. If you want to shoot in LA proper, you\\'re fucked because people will actually give a shit and pull your papers.  \\n\\nOnce you get to somewhere roughly 45 minutes east of downtown, it\\'s much easier.  \\n\\nAlso, just a note, I\\'ve been a part of a lot of work at Echo Park park and no one has ever pulled our papers. And we rolled in like 15 cast and crew deep. Remember, the most important phrase in LA, \"This is a student film.\" You flew off the handle because a city councilwoman went to Spago for  a nice meal? Are you fucking kidding me?   Going to be in GZ for work for two weeks so I\\'m looking for a bjj gym as well.  I know of a boxing gym already but hoping to get in well rounded work in.

Ferrari 458 because it might be the best car ever built.\\n\\nMcLaren because how often will you ever get to drive a McLaren.\\n\\nMercedes AMG GTS because it looks dope and you can do it for the gram.\\n Yes. It is weird.  Stop.  You do you, boo.  If you don\\'t want to give shit back, don\\'t. He ain\\'t gonna sue you for no dresser and blender (unless it\\'s a blendtec. I would sue my mother for a blendtec.) \\n\\nI\\'m not sure you mean in terms of \"safety\" though.  Do you mean legal safety or physical safety.  Because if it\\'s physical safety, I would definitely not risk life or limbs for a dresser and blender.  I would arrange for a time convenient for you (not him) to pick it up and have a friend present.  \\n\\nIf it\\'s just for legal \"safety\" then say fuck you and your whole motherfucking crew.  That motherfucker can see you or be you.  WEST SIDE TILL WE DIE- I\\'ve gotten off track.\\n\\nAnyways, depending on specific situation, you don\\'t have to give shit back to no one.   If you don\\'t want to wallow away in what-ifs for the rest of your life just be honest and tell him how you\\'re feeling.  Make sure you let him know if it is okay or not that he has the same feelings so that you may or may not remain friends.  \\n\\nLook, it\\'s much better to tell him how you feel now and then try to salvage the friendship if it doesn\\'t work out than to pretend like you don\\'t have feelings and sit in resentment for the next few months/years until it drives you the fuck crazy.  You\\'ll start doing super underhanded things and become a bad friend who is always a hater and drive each other apart. \\n\\nIf you want to remain friends, tell him now and deal with the consequences.  Unless you think you can bottle it up and then get over it.  In that case, that is also a very valid way to go.  Eireann (pronounced Erin) A few years back, I was planning to move away from my home town with three potential destinations: LA, Chicago, or New York.  The choice I make in that situation definitely dictated where I would be in my life.  Broccoli This is awesome.  One of my favorites shows of all time.  Not sure if I have any specific places to visit. They\\'re in Burbank and Downtown a bit.  Geo This.  And it leads to the root issue with vigilantism, the primary issue being that an individual decides that he/she is the judge, jury, and executioner.  \\n\\nSimply put, do we truly know a certain person has committed a despicable act? Is the act really despicable? Do we have overwhelming amounts of proof and evidence that this person committed those acts? Do we have impartial peers examining that evidence? \\n He seemed like such a nice man. He promised to make the galactic republic great again and to drain the Dagobah swamps.  Travis Scott ft.

One of the other comments put it best, seeking external validation is the quickest road to oblivion because some people will never give you your due credit.   Stereotypes exist for a reason.

It is basic isolationist attitude, leave civilizations to the fate they are destined to whether or not that means their oblivion.  \\n\\nWhat is the moral act in a case like such? Leaving a civilization to die when you could save them as the prime directive states or saving the civilization and exposing yourselves to them and violating the prime directive? Yup.  I found that out too when I bought the Meistersinger.  I expected a little more from a 500 dollar watch but hey, you win or you learn (available on Amazon and book stores everywhere).   I always wonder who are the savage engineers. Good hair.   End world hunger for years.  The Borgen Project estimates it would take 30 billion dollars a year to end world hunger.

Positive considering that the reality show, sitcom, NFL football watching Americans commissioned 5 different Star Trek series and also the shit show that was Andromeda, and to a lesser extent Firefly.   I had only been in LA for about 5 months.  She was from Astoria, Queens.  I met her after a night out at the bar at 2AM.  She had red hair all done up, a black dress.  I was disheveled, shirt unbuttoned, cigarette hanging out of my mouth.  \\n\\nI was opening my door when my neighbor walked home with a group of people.  Urging me to rally, I obliged because I am weak and he was peer pressuring me big time.  It was there where I met her.  I don\\'t remember her name.  I asked her if she was hungry.  She said yes.  We left my neighbor\\'s house and walked over to a 24 hour diner nearby.  We must\\'ve stayed in that diner talking for 4 hours.  By the time we walked out, the waitress looked pissed and the sun was creeping out.  I walked her back to her car which was parked obscenely far away.  She said our goodbyes.  I promised to call.

Extras don\\'t talk in the background, it\\'s their job to not talk.  The only sound you want to pick up is the dialogue.  You go back for room tone later.  Background talking is also added later from stock sounds.   They\\'re told to just mouth the word cantelope.  You can\\'t speak when you\\'re an extra because they are recording sound for dialogue.  You\\'re just mouthing silently towards another person and pretending to have a conversation so it\\'s 1000000000% silences, awkward or not.  If I had 1 million dollars liquid, that\\'s all the fuck you money I need.  Shit, I don\\'t have anywhere near the neighborhood adjacent to a million dollars and I still go around saying fuck you to everyone.   That is also a fear but at least that\\'ll give me a few hours of being super cool and fleeing from nuclear fallout.  If you\\'re going to die a horrible, agonizing death, you might as well get a cool story out of it.  People who ask me where I\\'m going/where I\\'ve been today.  I get it.

Also, just life tip, don\\'t think of it as you giving her a shot.  There is no superiority to a healthy relationship.  You are not granting her anything, you are not being merciful.  You are both lucky to have each other if you actually like each other. \\n\\nPhrasing it or thinking about it as you \"giving her a shot\" may lead to troubles later on.  \\n\\nRooting for you young peoples.  Good luck.   Naw fam, people like you are the worst of America.  \\n\\nOh, and this isn\\'t your country.  Fuck you.   Mostly because I find it entertaining and I\\'m kinda bored today.  Internet service providers, cable providers, tv channels, airlines, health insurance companies, monsanto.  \\n\\nMuch of the products and services most americans use are really from the same dozen or so companies.  We have this falsified choice and free market in this country but it is neither free nor really a market.  It\\'s choosing between Subsidiary A or Subisidary B of the same company.   Breh, I said he may or may not have broken the rule. Not getting caught breaking a rule does not mean he did or did not break that rule.  Lots of people didn\\'t get caught stealing shit, doesn\\'t mean they did or did not steal shit. \\n\\nAlso, this entire discussion is pointless because NO ONE IS CHALLENGING THE WEIGH IN. Oh and I also made up the article number and provision.  NYSAC Combat Sports page is a joke and the rulebook says nothing about weigh ins. \\n Uh... Rust is not merely cosmetic.  I know it\\'s cliche at this point to say but rust is the cancer of cars and it\\'s an expensive fix.   Most importantly rust. \\n\\nAlso, key is to bring it to your mechanic instead of trusting the seller\\'s people.  Make sure the car was never in any un-reported accidents.  \\n\\n Someone broke into my apartment while I was in there.  Shit went down.  I was in court to give testimony.  \\n\\nAlso speeding ticket.   You are in a sunken place.  The Hindenburg seemed to be a pretty big PR disaster.  Cutting Kanye West slack... goddammit kanye, you were the chosen one.   Three things I always check for: phone, wallet, and keys.  Everything else is extra.  \"The rule that I have been told that he broke was that he may (or may not) have used the assistance of holding onto the towel to make weight.\" The powers at be always view potential disturbances in a negative light.   lololol.  Expecting amoral companies to act out of the goodness of their non-existent hearts.  \\n\\nCompanies don\\'t unite together unless there is significant financial gain to be had not because they are evil but because their only goal and duty is to make money.  \\n\\n Bro... DAS WHAT I SAID.  WE AGREE, Y U GIVIN ME SHIT? Yes, you are right that in all cases UW is the best choice because you don\\'t have to pay.  I\\'m just trying to simply lay out that in no case go to UC Berkeley for 60k a year because fuck that.   If OP is 100% decided to going to law school, he can go to UW, SeattleU, Tacoma Community college, or really anywhere.  If he isn\\'t planning on going to law school, the undergrad degree matters more so go to UW.  It is not worth it, financially, in 99% of the cases to pay 60gs to go to UC Berkeley.   It\\'s a great strategy for the UFC when it\\'s as blatant as Gastelum vs Belfort.  They build new stars on the backs of old stars, it\\'s fighting and stardom is transferable.  Why let Anderson\\'s stardom leave the UFC, why not snatch it away and put it in a 25 year old kid who looks to be pretty damn good?   Countdown to Zero Some notes.\\n\\nA 9.0 would be absolutely crushing and the richter scale does not rise proportionately.  Let me explain: The difference between a 6.0 and a 7.0 is a smaller amount than the difference between a 7.0 and an 8.0.  Basically put, 1.0 richter scale \"point\" difference is not the same throughout the scale.  So in the example provided, a 9.4 would be devastating. \\n\\nThere are questions to whether or not the San Andreas Fault can even generate a 9.4 magnitude earthquake.  Research suggests that the San Andreas Fault would max out at an Earthquake of 8.3 and it would take an unprecedented amount of movement of the plates that make up the fault line.  \\n\\nDeath toll also depends on where the epicenter hits.  If it hits in the middle of the central valley, the death toll wouldn\\'t be large and neither would the devastation.  An Earthquake that could devastate everywhere from San Diego to San Francisco wouldn\\'t be an earthquake, it would be multiple devastating large earthquakes.\\n\\nAlso, the San Andreas fault would not cause any tsunamis as tsunamis are caused by earthquakes on fault lines within the ocean.  The San Andreas Fault is too far inland to cause any real tsunami.  \"I met Bill Clinton once. I would totally suck his dick.\" -My High School Sex Ed. Teacher.  Depends on how low the money and how much you like your job. \\n\\nIf it\\'s 80k for a job I love vs 100 for a job I hate, I take the job I love.\\n\\nIf it\\'s 30k for the job I love and 35mil for the job I hate, I don\\'t give a shit how I feel, I\\'m getting the 35mil. \\n\\nThe trick part is finding your line.  The difference between a 30k paying job and a 35k job is way bigger than 80k and 100k in terms of lifestyle.  Figure out where you draw the line and then act as such.  Same reason white people implemented anti-miscegenation laws in this country.  There are literally over 50 reasons why a check engine light comes on.  It could be as simple as needing a tune up just because the car has been driven for a very long time or something that will cost you upwards of a thousand dollars.  \\n\\nTake it to the mechanic and they can let you know what is wrong.  Not at the moment but I can take some.  Can you PM me your e-mail (i may have your phone from a move last time but not sure).  Probably NASCAR.  They drive the largest audiences at live events.  Amendment 28 - Corporations are not people.  The right for women to choose what to do with their body should be regulated in the sense that they should be kept safe and a medical professional should be handling it.  Otherwise, it\\'s their body, it\\'s their choice.   Not sure what legal precedent you\\'ve run into but you can still sue corporations even if they aren\\'t people.  You can sue organizations.   Nope.  Before we decided that corporations were people, we could still sue corporations.  Corporate personhood is not the indicator of whether or not we can sue.   My views on women are developing and evolving.  \\n\\nI think it is ridiculous to treat women like they are our property or to tell women what they can or cannot do with their own bodies and their own lives.  I think, economically, we should treat women as our exact equals.  Socially, we should strive to treat women as equal as possible.\\n\\nHowever, we also must acknowledge that men and women are not inherently the same beings. \\n\\nIt\\'s tough.  Not sure where the line is at the moment, still evolving.  General rule though is to not be a total dick hole about it.   Because we are gigantic assholes who, because we don\\'t have female reproductive organs, feel like we have the right to tell women what to do with theirs.  And even though the Supreme Court disagreed, we (we as in this country) is still doing as much as possible to prevent women from gettin the care they need. \\n\\nBecause we are gigantic, gaping assholes.   We regulate abortion clinics to make sure that women are getting safe treatment from medical professionals.  \\n\\nWe regulate planned parenthood overboard because we\\'re assholes and they\\'re trying to help women and men in their general health.   Kogi tacos.  The hype is not real y\\'all. I would need to get sourced on that one.  To my knowledge, Citizens United vs FEC cemented the corporate personhood idea and prior to that, most corporations were not afforded the same rights as individuals as they are not individuals.  \\n\\nPrior to that, we could still sue.  It\\'s the reason LLCs are LLCs and if someone gets injured on the job, they sue the company and not the manager.   It starts with their tortillas that they make in house.  It\\'s just on a different level from others.  Their meat is not the most impressive, their beans are pretty good but to me, it\\'s all in their tortilla.   I support Israel and Israel\\'s right to exist and the Israeli people.  I also support a two state solution (which is Israel\\'s official proposed solution).  \\n\\nI don\\'t know where the two states should start.  I think the settlements currently being built are an active provocation of conflict and I disagree with it.  \\n\\nDisagreeing Israeli policies does not mean that I don\\'t support Israel as a state.  Same with any country/nationality. They\\'ve been to Sydney a few times (last being Rockhold Bisping 1 in 2014)\\n\\nIt might be a venue thing but there are a whole host of facts as to why they rarely put on shows in Sydney.   The same exact candidates.  '"
